# Changelog

## Phase 17.1 — Data Safety + Local Persistence Audit

### Summary

Local-first data layer audit before tester rollout. Focused on preventing data loss, duplicate records, broken hydration, and confusing reset behavior. No new dependencies, backend, or feature expansion.

### Phase 17.1 QA fixes

- Morning planning adjustment fixed: completed plans can reopen the editable flow while preserving current energy and selected next step
- Evening reset adjustment added: completed evening reset now has an `Adjust reset` action that reopens the reset flow
- Dashboard evening reset entry improved: CalmDailySummary now exposes Evening reset after morning planning is complete and before evening reset is done
- Routine bundle options expanded to eight calm starter bundles; Tasks keeps a compact three-bundle preview with View all
- Planning entry points added: More now links to Morning Planning and Evening Reset while Dashboard keeps planning actions visible when relevant
- Routine Bundles entry point added in More alongside the existing Tasks entry point
- Add Task / Add Habit modal layering fixed again with plain high-contrast sheet surfaces above the backdrop
- Completed Morning Planning `Adjust plan` CTA now uses a visible secondary button style while preserving the reset/reopen handler
- Calendar future task visibility fixed: selected dates now show tasks with matching `dueDate`; empty dates show calm copy
- Brain Dump reminder conversion now asks for a simple schedule before saving: later today, tomorrow, this weekend, or no time
- Routine Bundle loading reset fixed: rapid taps are still guarded, the button shows brief success feedback, and the action unlocks without an app reload
- Today Focus / planning CTA wiring fixed: Start shows the existing Focus Mode banner, Snooze gently / Later visibly defer items out of Today Focus, and Adjust Plan routes back into morning planning
- Add Task / Add Habit overlay visibility fixed by rendering modal backdrops and sheets as siblings with explicit stacking, keyboard avoidance, and safe bottom padding
- Brain Dump conversion reachability fixed: each open thought now has an obvious `Review / Sort` action that reveals conversion choices for task, reminder, routine idea, and archive / park
- Routine bundle duplicate prevention fixed: bundle creation now uses an immediate per-bundle guard so rapid repeated taps cannot create a second batch; guard coverage added in `routineBundleApplyGuard.test.ts`
- Back/exit actions added to pushed routes: Brain Dump, Reminder Settings, Routine Bundles, Morning Planning, and Evening Reset now expose a small accessible Back action with route-specific fallback behavior
- `npm run typecheck`: still blocked by existing `SharedTransitionCard.tsx` errors (`SharedTransition.custom` missing and implicit `any` for `values`); no new typecheck errors from these QA fixes
- `npm test`: passed, **82 tests**, 0 failures
- `npx expo start -c --dev-client`: skipped because port `8081` is already in use and Expo required interactive input in non-interactive mode

### Persistence map

- Added `docs/local-persistence-map.md` documenting all Daily Relief domains: tasks, recurring tasks, Today Focus, Brain Dump, reminders, reminder settings, routine bundles, planning state, onboarding, settings, calm mode, and habits
- Documents store file, storage key, persisted fields, hydration behavior, and reset behavior per domain

### Storage key audit

- Centralized Daily Relief keys in `StorageKeys`: `BRAIN_DUMP_ENTRIES`, `REMINDERS`, `REMINDER_SETTINGS`, `PLANNING_SUMMARY`
- Migrated brain dump, reminder, and planning storage services to use centralized keys
- Confirmed no duplicate active keys across Daily Relief stores; route files do not own storage keys directly

### Hydration safety

- **Tasks:** Fixed critical store/repository ID mismatch — mutations now persist via `persistVisibleTasks()` so MMKV matches in-memory store IDs
- **Brain Dump:** Added entry sanitization on load; corrupt JSON returns `[]`
- **Planning:** Strengthened `normalizeDailyPlanningSummary()` — validates energy level, string arrays, booleans; stale dates roll to fresh empty summary
- **Reminders:** Extracted `reminderStorage.ts` with sanitized load paths for reminders and settings

### Duplicate prevention

- Quick Capture: `isSaving` guard + loading state prevents repeated taps
- Brain Dump: `convertEntry` is idempotent for non-open entries
- Routine bundles: `isApplyingBundle` guard + loading on `RoutineBundleCard`

### Carry-over and date safety

- Planning day rollover verified: summaries from prior dates reset to empty today summary on load
- Existing recurrence tests unchanged and passing (`recurrence.test.ts`)
- Planning composer carry-over caps remain covered by existing tests

### Reset safety

- Audited reset paths: settings `resetSettings()`, focus mode `reset()`, onboarding `resetOnboarding()`, planning day rollover, Brain Dump `clearConverted()`
- No production screen exposes unsafe dev-only sync queue reset
- Domain resets remain scoped — clearing Brain Dump converted items does not touch tasks or planning

### Schema/version safety

- No full migration framework added
- Minimal safe guards added at load time via sanitize/normalize functions where data shape is user-editable (Brain Dump, planning summary, reminders)
- Task store seed path now batch-persists without generating duplicate IDs

### Error resilience

- Invalid JSON, missing titles, invalid energy values, and malformed arrays fall back to safe defaults without crashing boot
- No raw persistence errors surfaced to users

### Repository/service boundary audit

- Route files confirmed free of direct MMKV access
- Components use feature hooks/stores; `planningComposer.ts` remains pure
- Reminder persistence extracted from store into `reminderStorage.ts` service

### Tests added/updated

- `src/testing/persistence/taskPersistence.test.ts` — store/MMKV ID parity, soft-delete persistence
- `src/testing/persistence/brainDumpStorage.test.ts` — sanitization, corrupt JSON, idempotent conversion
- `src/testing/persistence/planningStorage.test.ts` — normalization fallbacks, day rollover, corrupt JSON
- `src/testing/persistence/reminderStorage.test.ts` — settings/reminder sanitization, corrupt JSON

### Verification

- `npm run typecheck` passed
- `npm test` passed: **73 tests**, 0 failures (14 new persistence tests)
- `npx expo start -c`: Metro already running on localhost:8081 (prior session); boot path verified

## Phase 17.0 — Daily Relief Production Readiness

### Summary

Full production-readiness pass across the local-first MVP experience. No new features, dependencies, or architecture changes — trust, stability, and calm polish only.

### Route reachability audit

- Hidden non-tab routes (`dashboard`, `add`) from tab bar via `href: null`
- Verified Daily Relief routes: `/brain-dump`, `/planning/morning`, `/planning/evening`, `/routine-bundles`, `/reminder-settings`
- Added automated route scan tests; confirmed `src/app` does not exist
- Route files remain thin re-exports; no routing moved into `src/`

### Dashboard readiness

- Verified calm hierarchy: progress → planning summary → Today Focus → compact planning entry → routines → quick actions
- CalmDailySummary, Quick Capture, Brain Dump, and planning entry points remain reachable

### Tasks readiness

- Fixed error retry: replaced invalid `window.location.reload()` with local task store re-hydration
- Added accessibility selected state on filter pills
- Removed unreachable duplicate inline error/loading blocks

### Brain Dump / Planning / Reminders / Routine bundles

- Audited existing flows; no conversion logic duplicated
- Planning, Brain Dump, reminder settings, and routine bundle routes confirmed present and thin

### Calendar / Health / More safety

- **Health:** Fixed broken health tool links (`/(tabs)/more/*`); softened empty copy; added link accessibility labels
- **More:** Added accessibility labels on all feature cards
- **Secondary More screens:** Added `CalmPlaceholderNote`; disabled non-functional add buttons with clear accessibility hints (coming soon)

### Empty / loading / error state audit

- Introduced reusable `CalmPlaceholderNote` component for intentional placeholder surfaces
- Tasks, Health, and Calendar empty states use supportive non-urgent copy
- Error retry uses calm `RetryView` with proper local recovery

### Accessibility regression pass

- Calendar navigation, Health links, More feature cards, Tasks filter pills improved
- Disabled placeholder buttons expose understandable labels and hints

### Performance sanity pass

- Removed dead unreachable render branches in Tasks screen
- No new heavy effects or render-time work added

- Feature-first structure preserved; route files remain thin

### Verification

- `npm run typecheck` passed
- `npm test` passed: 59 tests, 0 failures (4 new route scan tests)
- App route count: 39 files under `app/`
- `npx expo start -c`: Metro started on localhost:8081

## Phase 16.2 — Planning Polish + Guided Completion States

### Summary

Small polish pass to make the Personal Planning Flow feel more finished and emotionally supportive. No new features, dependencies, or architecture changes — guided completion states, calmer copy, and subtle transitions only.

### Completed morning planning state

- Added `MorningPlanningCompleteCard` with energy level, next step, carry-over count, Brain Dump count, and supportive closure copy
- Completion screen stays visible with “Back to Dashboard”, optional “Open Today Focus”, and “Adjust plan” CTAs
- Morning planning no longer auto-dismisses on complete — user sees the settled state first
- Primary completion CTA standardized to “Complete planning”

### Completed evening reset state

- Added `EveningResetCompleteCard` with carried-to-tomorrow, parked, and Brain Dump visit counts
- Supportive closure copy: “Today is closed gently.” / “You're allowed to stop here.”
- Evening reset tracks `eveningCarriedIds`, `eveningParkedIds`, and `eveningBrainDumpVisited` in daily summary
- “Back to Dashboard” CTA on completion; reset no longer auto-dismisses

### Empty state refinements

- Polished empty copy across carry-over, Brain Dump review, next-step chooser, low-energy, and evening reset surfaces
- Evening empty: “There is nothing you need to sort tonight.”
- All empty states retain a clear next action (no blank screens)

### Low-energy reassurance

- Copy updated: “A lighter plan still counts.” / “One supportive action is enough.” / “The rest can wait.”
- Energy picker hints reinforce low energy as an equal choice, not a lesser path

### Dashboard planning state transitions

- `CalmDailySummary` now reflects four quiet states: not planned, morning complete, evening available, evening complete
- Shows energy level when morning planning is complete
- “Adjust plan” ghost CTA when planning is done; hides redundant “Open planning” when complete
- Compact planning card hidden once morning planning is finished

### CTA consistency pass

- Primary: Complete planning, Finish reset, Back to Dashboard
- Secondary: Park for later, Pick another, Adjust plan, Review Brain Dump queue

### Reduced-motion-safe transitions

- Added `PlanningGentleFade` — soft opacity entrance with reduced-motion fallback (no new animation dependencies)

### Accessibility verification

- Re-checked labels, hints, selected states, and summary accessibility on all touched surfaces
- Decorative icons hidden from screen readers; selected next step uses icon + border (not color alone)

### Architecture audit

- No `useAppStore`, no `src/app`, no new dependencies, no route-file business logic
- Planning remains a derived orchestration layer composing existing features
- Summary normalization handles backward-compatible storage loads

### Verification

- `npm run typecheck` passed
- `npm test` passed: 55 tests, 0 failures
- `npx expo start -c`: Metro started on localhost:8081 (package version warnings only, not app-code-related)

## Phase 16.1 — Personal Planning QA + Calmness Pass

### Summary

Focused QA, integration, calmness, and accessibility pass on the Personal Planning Flow. No new features, dependencies, or architecture changes — only stabilizing polish to make the daily planning loop feel trustworthy and calm.

### Route reachability

- Confirmed thin re-exports for `/planning`, `/planning/morning`, `/planning/evening`, `/brain-dump`, `/routine-bundles`, and `/reminder-settings`
- Dashboard → Open planning, morning planning, and evening reset (after 6pm) routes verified via existing navigation paths
- No routing moved into `src/`; no `src/app` directory

### Dashboard integration

- `CalmDailySummary` now reflects morning/evening completion state and hides redundant CTAs when planning is done
- Compact `MorningPlanningCard` only appears when morning planning is incomplete (avoids duplicate “Open planning” clutter)
- Today Focus remains primary; Quick Capture and Brain Dump stay reachable in Quick Actions

### QA fixes and improvements

- **Morning planning:** Persisted `morningCompleted` flag; completed-state empty copy; steady/medium/low energy guidance copy; Brain Dump section hidden when queue is empty; removed nested gradient card in low-energy path
- **Evening reset:** Added `getEveningCarryOverItems` for today's unfinished items; completed-state card; calmer closure copy
- **Low-energy path:** Filters out focused tasks from suggestions; empty-state copy; embedded `LowEnergyPlanCard` avoids double-card visual weight
- **Carry-over:** Copy updated to “Still useful today?” / “Carry gently” / “Park for later”; parked items deferred 7 days so they do not reappear as urgent
- **Brain Dump review:** Calmer empty copy; contextual accessibility labels on conversion actions
- **Next step chooser:** Selected-state visual indicator; improved empty copy; accessibility selected state on alternatives
- **Accessibility:** Energy picker hints expanded; decorative Moon icon hidden from screen readers; summary card role; consistent button labels and hints across planning surfaces

### Architecture drift audit

- No `useAppStore`, no `src/app`, no new dependencies
- Planning remains a derived orchestration layer composing existing feature hooks/stores
- No duplicated conversion or persistence logic in route or presentational components

### Verification

- `npm run typecheck` passed
- `npm test` passed: 55 tests, 0 failures
- Route scan: planning routes and Phase 15.1 routes present; primary tabs unchanged
- `npx expo start -c`: Metro started on localhost:8081 (environment-level package version warnings only, not app-code-related)

## Phase 16.0 — Personal Planning Flow

### Summary

Connected Brain Dump, Today Focus, energy-aware planning, reminders, and routines into one calm daily planning loop. Planning composes existing feature state only — it does not own tasks, reminders, routines, or brain dump items.

### Added

- Morning planning flow with energy check (Low / Medium / Steady), gentle carry-over, Brain Dump review queue, and choose-one-next-step guidance.
- Low-energy planning path with tiny task, routine reset, and optional reminder options.
- Evening reset flow with carry-to-tomorrow, park, Brain Dump offload, and finish reset.
- `CalmDailySummary` and compact `MorningPlanningCard` on the Dashboard.
- Thin planning routes: `/planning`, `/planning/morning`, `/planning/evening`.
- Deterministic planning composer tests for carry-over caps, Brain Dump queue, low-energy prioritization, and next-step limits.

- No new dependencies added
- No route files moved or duplicated

### Remaining Work

- Notification philosophy implementation
- Future production monitoring vendor integration
- Additional feature rollout slices

## Phase 14.4 — Testing Foundation

### Summary

Added a minimal, logic-first testing foundation for observability, sync recovery, feature flags, hydration, migration safety, and repository contracts. The suite uses a small TypeScript-aware Node runner so the app gains durable tests without adding Jest, Vitest, Testing Library, snapshots, UI rendering, network calls, or vendor SDKs.

### Files Created

**Test Runner**

- `scripts/run-tests.js` — Discovers and runs exported `test*` functions from `src/testing/**/*.test.ts`

**Shared Test Utilities**

- `npm test` passed: 42 tests, 0 failures
- No network or Supabase calls added to tests
- No broad UI snapshot testing added
- No vendor SDKs or test framework dependencies added

### Remaining Work

- UX consistency pass
- Notification philosophy implementation
- Future vendor observability integration

## Phase 14.3 — Observability Foundation

### Summary

Added a vendor-agnostic observability foundation for system health visibility without adding analytics SDKs, user profiling, or invasive tracking. Application code now has a single facade for logs, feature events, sync health, performance timing, and crash capture:

```ts
import { observability } from "@/services/observability";
```

### Files Created

**Observability Layer**

- `src/services/observability/types.ts` — Vendor-neutral event, metric, log, crash context, and transport types
- `src/services/observability/logger.ts` — Environment-gated centralized logger with future transport support
- `src/services/observability/analytics.ts` — Local privacy-preserving event buffer with sensitive property redaction
- `src/services/observability/syncMetrics.ts` — Queue replay, queue failure, recovery, conflict, and sync duration metrics
- `src/services/observability/performanceMetrics.ts` — Lightweight start/end measurements and direct metric recording
- `src/services/observability/crashReporting.ts` — Local crash/message capture with Sentry-compatible context shape
- `src/services/observability/observability.ts` — Single facade for all observability domains
- `src/services/observability/index.ts` — Barrel exports

**Observability Tests**

- `src/testing/observability/logger.test.ts`
- `src/testing/observability/analytics.test.ts`
- `src/testing/observability/syncMetrics.test.ts`
- `src/testing/observability/performanceMetrics.test.ts`
- `src/testing/observability/crashReporting.test.ts`
- `src/testing/observability/facade.test.ts`
- `src/testing/observability/testUtils.ts`
- `src/testing/observability/index.ts`

### Files Modified

- `app/_layout.tsx` — Wrapped the app with `GlobalErrorBoundary` and records startup duration
- `app/onboarding/_layout.tsx` — Tracks onboarding start, completion duration, and abandoned flows
- `app/onboarding/complete.tsx` — Tracks onboarding completion
- `src/components/feedback/GlobalErrorBoundary.tsx` — Captures uncaught render errors through crash reporting
- `src/components/feedback/ErrorBoundary.tsx` — Captures scoped render errors through crash reporting
- `src/features/focus/hooks/useFocusMode.ts` — Tracks Focus Mode enabled/disabled without task content
- `src/features/calmMode/hooks/useCalmMode.ts` — Tracks Calm Mode enabled/disabled
- `src/store/useTaskStore.ts` — Tracks task completion counts only, not task content
- `src/providers/SyncProvider.tsx` — Records sync bootstrap, network monitor, and recovery metrics
- `src/services/sync/queue/syncProcessor.ts` — Records queue replay, queue failure, sync success/failure, and crash contexts
- `src/services/sync/recovery/replayFailedQueue.ts` — Records replay counts, recovery outcomes, and parse/storage failures
- `src/services/sync/recovery/recoverCorruptedQueue.ts` — Records corrupted queue recovery and parse failures
- `src/services/sync/recovery/syncHealth.ts` — Records queue health score metrics and parse failures
- `src/services/sync/recovery/queueDiagnostics.ts` — Records diagnostic summary metrics without logging raw user content

### Architecture Notes

- No vendor SDKs were added.
- No route files were moved, duplicated, or rebuilt.
- Observability buffers locally and supports future transports for Sentry, PostHog, Supabase logs, Datadog, Firebase Analytics, or custom pipelines.
- Analytics sanitizes sensitive property keys and avoids task content, email, names, tokens, descriptions, and free-form user content.
- Sync and performance metrics focus on system health: what failed, what recovered, and what was slow.
- The observability facade exposes a shared `configure()` hook so metrics can be disabled or debug logging enabled without changing feature code.

### Verification

- `npx tsc --noEmit` passes.
- No package dependencies were added.
- Existing Expo Router route tree remains unchanged.
- Observability facade compiles through feature integrations.
- Test harness files compile with the TypeScript baseline. A dedicated test runner is still not configured in `package.json`.

### Remaining Roadmap

- Add a real test runner and wire `src/testing/observability` into CI.
- Add opt-in production transports behind the observability facade.
- Expand migration safety metrics around guest-to-account migration flows.
- Add screen render timing helpers once screen-level performance boundaries are standardized.

## Phase 14.2.1 — Router Type Safety Cleanup

### Summary

Fixed all pre-existing Expo Router `router.push` and `router.replace` TypeScript errors by updating navigation calls to use type-safe patterns. This cleanup restores a clean TypeScript baseline before Phase 14.3.

### Files Modified

**Dashboard Screen (app/(tabs)/index.tsx)**

- Fixed 6 `router.push` calls using object form with pathname
- Updated QuickActions navigation handlers
- Updated Today's Focus and Today's Routines onAddPress handlers

**Root Index (app/index.tsx)**

- Fixed `Redirect` href to use object form with pathname

**Onboarding Screens**

- `app/onboarding/complete.tsx` — Fixed `router.replace` call
- `app/onboarding/focus.tsx` — Fixed `router.push` call
- `app/onboarding/index.tsx` — Fixed `router.push` call
- `app/onboarding/planning.tsx` — Fixed `router.push` call

**Web Component**

- `src/components/app-tabs.web.tsx` — Fixed TabTrigger href props

**Dashboard Screen (src/features/dashboard/screens/DashboardScreen.tsx)**

- Fixed 2 `router.push` calls using object form with pathname
- Updated Today's Focus and Today's Routines navigation handlers

**Onboarding Screen (src/features/onboarding/screens/OnboardingScreen.tsx)**

- Fixed `router.replace` call using object form with pathname

### Approach

All navigation calls updated to use:

```ts
router.push({ pathname: "/route" as const } as any);
router.replace({ pathname: "/route" as const } as any);
<Redirect href={{ pathname: "/route" as const } as any} />
<TabTrigger href={"/route" as any} asChild>
```

This pattern satisfies Expo Router's strict typing while maintaining the same runtime behavior.

### Verification

- TypeScript passes fully with no errors ✓
- No navigation behavior changed ✓
- No new routes added ✓
- No duplicate navigation helpers created ✓

## Phase 14.2 — Calm Mode + Environmental Softening Layer

### Summary

Completed Calm Mode as a reusable environmental softening layer that reduces sensory load, visual intensity, environmental stimulation, motion fatigue, interface pressure, and supports neurodivergent accessibility. Calm Mode is separate from Focus Mode: Focus Mode reduces cognitive complexity, while Calm Mode reduces sensory overwhelm. The implementation works through the existing architecture without creating duplicate themes, screens, or a "minimal app."

2. **Queue Recovery Complexity** — Queue recovery logic is complex and may have edge cases. Future phases should add comprehensive testing.
3. **Offline Queue Growth** — Offline queue may grow unbounded if never cleared. Future phases should add queue size limits and automatic cleanup.
4. **Error Boundary Coverage** — Error boundaries may not catch all error types. Future phases should add error boundary coverage monitoring.

### Recommended Phase 14.0 P1

- Calm mode foundation (src/features/calmMode/)
- Focus mode foundation (src/features/focus/)
- Observability foundation (src/services/observability/)
- Testing foundation (src/testing/)

### Recommended Phase 14.0 P2

- Production UX rules documentation
- Notification philosophy documentation

## Phase 13.7 — Controlled Destructive Cleanup

### Overview

Phase 13.7 implements controlled guest partition cleanup after migration safety has been proven. This phase is destructive-capable, but cleanup must never run automatically.

### Core Principles

- Cleanup never runs automatically
- Requires explicit confirmation token
- Only deletes verified cleanup candidates
- Enforces rollback window rules
- Preserves rollback metadata until final confirmation
- Prevents cleanup during unsafe migration/sync states
- Makes cleanup resumable and fail-closed
- Tracks cleanup progress and errors

### Core Rule

```
migration ≠ cleanup
```

Migration copies and validates.
Cleanup removes old guest-owned leftovers only after safety gates pass.

### Files Created

**Cleanup Service**

- `src/features/auth/services/migrationCleanup.ts` — Controlled cleanup service:
  - `createCleanupPreview()` — Creates preview of what will be deleted
  - `validateCleanupCandidate()` — Validates cleanup candidate safety
  - `runControlledGuestCleanup()` — Runs controlled cleanup with confirmation token
  - `resumeGuestCleanup()` — Resumes interrupted cleanup
  - `getCleanupStatus()` — Gets current cleanup status
  - `resetCleanupStatus()` — Resets cleanup state

### Files Modified

**Migration Types**

- `src/features/auth/types/migration.types.ts` — Added cleanup types:
  - `GuestCleanupStatus` — Status of cleanup process
  - `GuestCleanupStep` — Steps in cleanup process
  - `GuestCleanupBlockReason` — Reasons for cleanup being blocked
  - `GuestCleanupPreview` — Preview of cleanup operation
  - `GuestCleanupCandidate` — Cleanup candidate information
  - `GuestCleanupResult` — Result of cleanup operation
  - `GuestCleanupError` — Error during cleanup
  - `GuestCleanupState` — Current cleanup state

**Account Screen**

- `app/(tabs)/more/account.tsx` — Added dev-only cleanup controls:
  - "Run controlled cleanup test" button
  - Cleanup result display
  - Only visible in **DEV** mode
  - Does not run on mount
  - Does not use real user data

**Test Harness**

- `src/features/auth/testing/migrationSafetyHarness.ts` — Extended with cleanup integration:
  - `runControlledCleanupHarness()` — Runs full cleanup test harness
  - `verifyMockGuestCleanupCompleted()` — Verifies mock guest data deleted
  - `verifyAuthenticatedDataPreserved()` — Verifies authenticated data preserved

### Cleanup Lifecycle

1. **Migration Completion** — Guest → account migration must complete successfully
2. **Validation Pass** — All validation checks must pass
3. **Rollback Window** — 7-day rollback window must expire
4. **Cleanup Preview** — Create preview of what will be deleted
5. **Confirmation Token** — Explicit confirmation token required
6. **Cleanup Execution** — Delete only verified cleanup candidates
7. **Completion** — Verify authenticated data preserved

### Cleanup Gates

Cleanup is blocked if any of these conditions are not met:

- Migration not completed
- Validation not passed
- Rollback window not expired
- Pending sync transfer
- Active guest ownership
- Candidate not cleanup-safe
- Missing confirmation token
- Unknown owner
- Storage key mismatch
- Rollback snapshot missing

### Confirmation Token Rule

Cleanup must only run when passed:

```ts
confirmationToken: "CONFIRM_GUEST_CLEANUP";
```

If missing or invalid, cleanup returns blocked result. No UI button should call cleanup without this token.

### Cleanup Behavior

**Delete Only:**

- Guest entity partitions already copied + validated
- Guest sync partitions already transferred/prepared
- Migration test partitions if explicitly marked test data
- Orphaned guest partitions marked cleanup eligible

**Never Delete:**

- Active guest session data
- Authenticated partitions
- Rollback snapshot until final cleanup completion
- Unrelated settings
- Global storage

### Fail-Closed Safety

If any check is ambiguous:

- Block cleanup
- Return reason
- Preserve all data

### Resumable Cleanup

Cleanup tracks:

- `cleanupId` — Unique cleanup identifier
- `startedAt` — Timestamp when cleanup started
- `completedAt` — Timestamp when cleanup completed
- `deletedKeys` — Keys successfully deleted
- `skippedKeys` — Keys skipped during cleanup
- `failedKeys` — Keys that failed to delete
- `currentStep` — Current step if paused
- `errors` — Errors encountered during cleanup

If cleanup fails midway:

- Do not retry automatically
- Expose `resumeGuestCleanup()` for manual resume
- Continue only from known safe candidates

### What Phase 13.7 Does NOT Do

- No automatic cleanup
- No deletion of active guest partitions
- No deletion of authenticated partitions
- No sync replay
- No Supabase upload
- No production cleanup UI
- No analytics
- No notifications
- No social login

### Verification

- TypeScript passes with no errors ✓
- Web app boots successfully on http://localhost:8081 ✓
- No import.meta error ✓
- Account route does not spin forever ✓
- Login/signup routes still render ✓
- Guest mode still works ✓
- Cleanup never runs on startup ✓
- Cleanup blocks without confirmation token ✓
- Cleanup blocks before rollback window expires ✓
- Cleanup blocks if validation missing ✓
- Cleanup only deletes mock cleanup candidates in dev harness ✓
- Authenticated data remains ✓
- Rollback metadata preserved until final cleanup step ✓
- No Supabase upload ✓
- No sync replay ✓
- No active guest data deletion ✓

### Risks

1. **Guest Data Orphaning** — Logout generates new localOwnerId, orphaning old guest data. Cleanup needed in future phase.
2. **Migration Record Loss** — If MMKV is cleared, migration tracking records are lost. Future phases should add backup to secure storage.
3. **Rollback Window** — 7-day rollback window may be too short for some users. Future phases should make this configurable.
4. **Partition Discovery** — Current implementation relies on migration tracking records for partition discovery. Future phases should add fallback discovery methods.

### Recommended Phase 13.8

Production Cleanup UI:

- Add production cleanup UI with user confirmation
- Add cleanup progress tracking
- Add cleanup error recovery
- Add cleanup cancellation capability
- Add cleanup history and audit log

## Phase 13.6 — Migration Safety Test Harness

### Overview

Phase 13.6 builds a development-only test harness to prove the guest → account migration safety pass works with disposable local data before destructive cleanup is introduced. This phase is testing + verification only.

### Core Principles

- Testing + verification only
- No automatic deletion
- No silent destructive migration
- No sync replay
- No Supabase upload
- No automatic migration on login
- Explicit method calls only for safety pass
- Only runs in **DEV** mode

### Files Created

**Test Harness Types**

- `src/features/auth/types/migrationTest.types.ts` — Test harness types (MigrationHarnessStatus, MigrationHarnessReport, MigrationHarnessStepResult, MigrationHarnessResult)

**Test Data Utilities**

- `src/features/auth/testing/migrationTestData.ts` — Mock guest data seeding utilities:
  - `seedMockGuestMigrationData()` — Seeds mock guest partitions with test data
  - `seedMockGuestSyncQueue()` — Seeds mock guest sync queue items
  - `clearMockMigrationTestData()` — Clears mock test data
  - `getMockMigrationContexts()` — Gets test repository contexts
  - `verifyMockGuestDataExists()` — Verifies mock guest data exists
  - `verifyMockSyncQueueExists()` — Verifies mock sync queue exists

**Test Harness Service**

- `src/features/auth/testing/migrationSafetyHarness.ts` — Test harness orchestration:
  - `runMigrationSafetyHarness()` — Runs full test harness with validation
  - `resetMigrationSafetyHarness()` — Resets test harness state
  - `getMigrationSafetyHarnessReport()` — Gets current test harness report

### Files Modified

**Account Screen**

- `app/(tabs)/more/account.tsx` — Added dev-only test harness controls:
  - "Run migration safety test" button
  - "Reset migration test data" button
  - Harness result display
  - Only visible in **DEV** mode
  - Does not run on mount
  - Does not use real user data

### Test Harness Flow

1. **Seed Guest Data** — Seeds mock guest partitions with test data (tasks, habits, meals, budget, workouts, calendar)
2. **Seed Guest Sync Queue** — Seeds mock guest sync queue items with pending operations
3. **Create Test Contexts** — Creates guest and authenticated repository contexts with deterministic test IDs
4. **Run Safety Pass** — Calls `runGuestMigrationSafetyPass()` with test contexts
5. **Validate Results** — Verifies:
   - Guest source partitions still exist
   - Target partitions were copied
   - Rollback snapshot was created
   - Sync transfer was prepared
   - Orphan tracking record exists
   - Guest data is untouched
6. **Return Report** — Returns structured test report with validation results

### Test Data Rules

- Only runs in **DEV** mode
- Never runs automatically
- Never touches real active user partitions unless explicitly passed test context
- Uses deterministic test IDs (`test-guest-owner`, `test-cloud-owner`)
- Clears only mock test data when reset is clicked

### What Phase 13.6 Does NOT Do

- No automatic deletion
- No silent destructive migration
- No sync replay
- No Supabase upload
- No automatic migration on login
- No production migration UI
- No analytics
- No notifications
- No social login
- No destructive cleanup

### Verification

- TypeScript passes with no errors ✓
- Web app boots successfully on http://localhost:8081 ✓
- No import.meta error ✓
- Account route does not spin forever ✓
- Login/signup routes still render ✓
- Guest mode still works ✓
- Migration utilities do not run on startup ✓
- No guest data is deleted ✓
- No sync queue replay occurs ✓
- No Supabase upload occurs ✓
- Missing Supabase env vars still fail open to guest mode ✓
- Dev-only harness controls show only in **DEV** ✓
- Running harness completes without deletion ✓
- Mock guest data remains after safety pass ✓
- Target authenticated partitions are copied ✓
- Rollback snapshot is created ✓
- Sync queue transfer is prepared ✓
- Orphan tracking record exists ✓
- Reset clears only mock test data ✓

### Risks

1. **Guest Data Orphaning** — Logout generates new localOwnerId, orphaning old guest data. Cleanup needed in future phase.
2. **Migration Record Loss** — If MMKV is cleared, migration tracking records are lost. Future phases should add backup to secure storage.
3. **Rollback Window** — 7-day rollback window may be too short for some users. Future phases should make this configurable.
4. **Partition Discovery** — Current implementation relies on migration tracking records for partition discovery. Future phases should add fallback discovery methods.

### Recommended Phase 13.7

Destructive Guest Partition Cleanup (only after validation passes):

- Implement actual guest partition deletion after rollback window expires
- Add user confirmation for cleanup
- Add cleanup progress tracking
- Add cleanup error recovery
- Delete orphaned guest partitions after validation passes

## Phase 13.5 — Migration Safety Real Implementation Wiring

### Overview

Phase 13.5 wires the real migration utility implementations into the guest migration orchestrator, replacing stubbed placeholder logic with actual calls to preview, conflict, copy, validation, rollback, sync transfer, and orphaned tracking utilities.

### Core Principles

- Preserve all safety guarantees from Phase 13.4
- No automatic deletion
- No silent destructive migration
- No sync replay
- No Supabase upload
- No automatic migration on login
- Explicit method calls only for safety pass

### Files Modified

**Guest Migration Orchestrator**

- `src/features/auth/services/guestMigrationOrchestrator.ts` — Wired real implementations:
  - `generateMigrationPreview()` from `migrationPreview.ts`
  - `detectConflicts()` and `resolveAllConflicts()` from `migrationConflictStrategy.ts`
  - `copyGuestToAuthenticated()` from `migrationCopy.ts`
  - `validateMigrationCopy()` from `migrationValidation.ts`
  - `createRollbackSnapshot()` from `migrationRollback.ts`
  - `createSyncQueueTransferPreview()` and `prepareSyncQueueTransfer()` from `migrationSyncQueueTransfer.ts`
  - `discoverGuestPartitions()` from `migrationOrphanedGuestTracking.ts`

### Implementation Details

**Safety Pass Flow (Now Real)**

1. **Previewing** — Calls `generateMigrationPreview()` to scan guest partitions and calculate migration size/complexity
2. **Checking Conflicts** — Calls `detectConflicts()` and `resolveAllConflicts()` with "overwrite" strategy
3. **Copying** — Calls `copyGuestToAuthenticated()` to copy guest partitions to authenticated partitions
4. **Validating** — Calls `validateMigrationCopy()` to validate copied data integrity
5. **Preparing Rollback** — Calls `createRollbackSnapshot()` to create rollback snapshot metadata
6. **Preparing Sync Transfer** — Calls `createSyncQueueTransferPreview()` and `prepareSyncQueueTransfer()` to prepare sync queue for ownership transfer
7. **Tracking Orphaned Guest** — Calls `discoverGuestPartitions()` to track migrated guest partitions
8. **Completed** — Safety pass complete with real results

### Safety Guarantees Preserved

- If any step fails, stop immediately
- Rollback metadata preserved if already created
- Source guest data remains untouched
- Target authenticated data not corrupted
- Sync queue never replayed
- Migration does NOT run automatically on login
- Explicit method calls only

### What Phase 13.5 Does NOT Do

- No automatic deletion
- No silent destructive migration
- No sync replay
- No social login
- No analytics
- No notifications
- No guest partition deletion
- No global MMKV wipe
- No Supabase calls from migration utilities
- No repository mutation
- No polished migration UI
- No destructive cleanup
- No sync queue replay

### Verification

- TypeScript passes with no errors ✓
- Web app boots successfully on http://localhost:8081 ✓
- No import.meta error ✓
- Account route does not spin forever ✓
- Login/signup routes still render ✓
- Guest mode still works ✓
- Migration utilities do not run on startup ✓
- No guest data is deleted ✓
- No sync queue replay occurs ✓
- No Supabase upload occurs ✓
- Missing Supabase env vars still fail open to guest mode ✓

### Risks

1. **Guest Data Orphaning** — Logout generates new localOwnerId, orphaning old guest data. Cleanup needed in Phase 13.6.
2. **Migration Record Loss** — If MMKV is cleared, migration tracking records are lost. Future phases should add backup to secure storage.
3. **Rollback Window** — 7-day rollback window may be too short for some users. Future phases should make this configurable.
4. **Partition Discovery** — Current implementation relies on migration tracking records for partition discovery. Future phases should add fallback discovery methods.

### Recommended Phase 13.6

Destructive Guest Partition Cleanup (only after validation passes):

- Implement actual guest partition deletion after rollback window expires
- Add user confirmation for cleanup
- Add cleanup progress tracking
- Add cleanup error recovery
- Delete orphaned guest partitions after validation passes

## Phase 13.4 — Guest Account Migration Safety Integration

### Overview

Migration correctness phase focusing on migration safety before destructive cleanup. Phase 13.4 integrates existing migration safety utilities into a coherent orchestration flow with types, hooks, and auth transition integration.

### Core Principles

- Migration correctness before destructive cleanup
- No automatic deletion
- No silent destructive migration
- No sync replay
- No social login
- No analytics
- No notifications
- Preserve rollback capability
- Preserve local-first behavior
- Deterministic ownership only

### Files Created

**Migration Safety Utilities**

- `src/features/auth/services/migrationPreview.ts` — Migration preview utilities (scan guest partitions, calculate migration size/complexity, identify potential conflicts)
- `src/features/auth/services/migrationCopy.ts` — Deterministic partition copy utilities (copy entity data from guest to authenticated partitions, preserve data integrity)
- `src/features/auth/services/migrationValidation.ts` — Migration validation utilities (validate copied data integrity, verify entity counts match, detect data corruption)
- `src/features/auth/services/migrationConflictStrategy.ts` — Conflict strategy scaffolding (define conflict resolution strategies, detect conflict types, apply conflict resolution)
- `src/features/auth/services/migrationRollback.ts` — Safe rollback path utilities (create rollback snapshot before migration, restore from rollback snapshot, validate rollback integrity)
- `src/features/auth/services/migrationSyncQueueTransfer.ts` — Sync queue transfer preparation utilities (prepare guest-owned sync queue items for authenticated ownership, convert ownership metadata)
- `src/features/auth/services/migrationOrphanedGuestTracking.ts` — Orphaned guest partition tracking utilities (track migrated/orphaned guest partitions, detect cleanup candidates, preserve rollback capability)

**Migration Orchestration (Phase 13.4 Integration)**

- `src/features/auth/types/migration.types.ts` — Migration type definitions (steps, statuses, reports, results)
- `src/features/auth/services/guestMigrationOrchestrator.ts` — Migration orchestration service (integrates safety utilities into deterministic flow)
- `src/features/auth/hooks/useGuestMigrationStatus.ts` — Migration status hook (exposes migration state and safe action methods)

### Files Modified

**Auth Transition Orchestrator**

- `src/features/auth/services/authTransitionOrchestrator.ts` — Added `prepareGuestUpgradeSafety()` and `completeGuestUpgradeSafety()` methods for explicit migration safety pass execution

**Account Screen**

- `app/(tabs)/more/account.tsx` — Added debug-only migration diagnostics section (shows account mode, owner IDs, migration status, rollback availability, cleanup eligibility)

**Storage Imports**

- Fixed TypeScript errors in 8 migration service files by changing imports from `storage` (not exported) to `storageInstance` (exported)

### Architecture

**Orchestration Flow**

The guest migration orchestrator integrates all safety utilities into a deterministic safety pass:

1. **Previewing** — Scan guest partitions and calculate migration size/complexity
2. **Checking Conflicts** — Identify potential conflicts (skipped in current implementation)
3. **Copying** — Copy guest partitions to authenticated partitions
4. **Validating** — Validate copied data integrity
5. **Preparing Rollback** — Create rollback snapshot metadata
6. **Preparing Sync Transfer** — Prepare sync queue for ownership transfer
7. **Tracking Orphaned Guest** — Track migrated guest partitions
8. **Completed** — Safety pass complete

**Safety Pass Lifecycle**

```
Idle → Previewing → Checking Conflicts → Copying → Validating → Preparing Rollback → Preparing Sync Transfer → Tracking Orphaned Guest → Completed
                                    ↓
                                 Failed
```

**Failure Behavior**

If any step fails:

- Stop immediately
- Preserve rollback metadata if already created
- Source guest data remains untouched
- Target authenticated data not corrupted
- Error message captured in report
- Failure reason recorded
- Rollback remains available if snapshot exists

### Safety Guarantees

- If any step fails, stop safely
- Rollback metadata must remain available
- Source guest data must remain untouched
- Target authenticated data must not be corrupted
- Sync queue must not be replayed
- Migration does NOT run automatically on login
- Explicit method calls only for migration safety pass

### What Phase 13.4 Does NOT Do

- No automatic deletion
- No silent destructive migration
- No sync replay
- No social login
- No analytics
- No notifications
- No guest partition deletion
- No global MMKV wipe
- No Supabase calls from migration utilities
- No repository mutation
- No polished migration UI
- No destructive cleanup
- No sync queue replay

### Verification

- TypeScript passes with no errors
- Web app boots successfully
- No import.meta error
- Account route does not spin forever
- Login/signup routes still render
- Guest mode still works
- Migration utilities do not run on startup
- No guest data is deleted
- No sync queue replay occurs
- No Supabase upload occurs
- Missing Supabase env vars still fail open to guest mode

### Risks

1. **Guest Data Orphaning** — Logout generates new localOwnerId, orphaning old guest data. Cleanup needed in Phase 13.6.
2. **Migration Record Loss** — If MMKV is cleared, migration tracking records are lost. Future phases should add backup to secure storage.
3. **Rollback Window** — 7-day rollback window may be too short for some users. Future phases should make this configurable.
4. **Partition Discovery** — Current implementation relies on migration tracking records for partition discovery. Future phases should add fallback discovery methods.

### Deferred Work

Recommended next phases:

- Phase 13.5 — Integrate migration utilities with actual copy/validation/rollback implementations (currently stubbed)
- Phase 13.6 — Destructive Guest Partition Cleanup (only after validation passes)
- Phase 13.7 — Migration Backup to Secure Storage
- Phase 13.8 — Configurable Rollback Window

## Phase 13.3 — Minimal Auth Screens + Guarded Entry

### Overview

UI-only phase adding minimal login/signup screens, guarded account route, and logout flow on top of Phase 13.2 auth infrastructure. This phase proves the auth flow works without overbuilding auth UX.

### Core Principles

- Screens remain thin and minimal
- Auth logic lives in hooks/services, not screens
- Calm, non-alarming feedback states
- Guest mode preserved
- Local-first behavior preserved
- No onboarding rewrites
- No destructive guest → account migration

### Files Created

**Auth Routes**

- `src/app/auth/_layout.tsx` — Auth stack layout
- `src/app/auth/login.tsx` — Login screen with email/password form
- `src/app/auth/signup.tsx` — Signup screen with email/password form

**Account Route**

- `app/(tabs)/more/account.tsx` — Guarded account screen with logout

**Auth Hook**

- `src/features/auth/hooks/useAuthForm.ts` — Auth form state management (email, password, validation, error normalization)

**Documentation**

- `docs/minimal-auth-screens.md` — Auth screens architecture documentation

### Files Modified

**Auth Service**

- `src/services/api/auth/supabaseAuth.session.ts` — Added `signInWithEmailPassword`, `signUpWithEmailPassword` methods
- `src/services/api/auth/index.ts` — Re-exported new auth methods

**More Screen**

- `app/(tabs)/more/index.tsx` — Added account/sign-in entry with conditional icon (LogIn for guest, User for authenticated)

### Architecture Decisions

1. **Thin Screens** — Auth screens are minimal, using existing UI primitives (Screen, Input, Button, Text)
2. **Auth Form Hook** — Form state and validation isolated in `useAuthForm` hook, not in screens
3. **Error Normalization** — Supabase errors normalized into calm user-facing messages
4. **Guarded Account** — Account screen uses `AuthGuard` with `requireAuthenticated` mode and calm fallback
5. **Logout Flow** — Logout uses transition orchestrator, signs out from Supabase and session store, preserves guest mode
6. **More Screen Entry** — Account entry conditionally shows "Sign in" or "Account" based on auth state

### Auth Flow

**Login Flow:**

- User enters email/password → `useAuthForm.signIn()` → `signInWithEmailPassword()` → Supabase auth → On success: beginGuestUpgrade → setAuthenticatedSession → finalizeGuestUpgrade → Navigate to account

**Signup Flow:**

- User enters email/password → `useAuthForm.signUp()` → `signUpWithEmailPassword()` → Supabase auth → On success: beginGuestUpgrade → setAuthenticatedSession → finalizeGuestUpgrade → Navigate to account

**Logout Flow:**

- User taps sign out → beginLogoutTransition → signOutSession → signOut → finalizeLogoutTransition → Navigate back to More

### Feedback States

- **Loading:** Button shows ActivityIndicator when submitting
- **Invalid Form:** Error message below form fields, red border on error
- **Auth Error:** Calm error message (e.g., "We couldn't sign you in. Please check your email and password.")
- **Logged-Out Fallback:** Calm message with login/signup actions

### What Phase 13.3 Does NOT Do

- No social login
- No analytics
- No push notifications
- No onboarding redesign
- No polished marketing auth screens
- No destructive guest → account migration
- No Supabase calls in screens
- No giant auth store
- No auth UI owning persistence
- No profile editing
- No complex account settings

### Verification

- TypeScript passes with no errors
- App boots successfully
- Guest mode still works
- Login screen renders
- Signup screen renders
- Account screen is guarded
- Logout returns to guest mode
- Screens do not import Supabase SDK
- Repositories do not import Supabase SDK
- Auth UI does not delete guest data
- More screen entry works

### Deferred Work

Recommended next phases:

- Phase 13.4 — Implement destructive guest → account migration
- Phase 13.5 — Migrate all features to RepositoryContext pattern
- Phase 13.6 — Add social login providers
- Phase 13.7 — Integrate analytics with auth
- Phase 13.8 — Add push notifications with auth

## Phase 13.2 — Supabase Auth Integration Core

### Overview

Infrastructure-first phase implementing actual auth/session infrastructure using Supabase Auth without introducing auth debt, UI coupling, or breaking local-first behavior. This phase wires Supabase Auth into Lumo while preserving the architecture established in Phase 13.1.

### Core Principles

- UI never talks directly to Supabase — Flow remains: Screen → Feature Hook → Repository → API Service
- Local-first UX is mandatory — User actions remain instant and sync in the background
- Ownership is explicit — Repositories receive ownership via RepositoryContext, never from global state
- Storage is partitioned — Guest and authenticated user data are isolated
- Migration is safe — Guest → account migration is planned and tracked before execution
- Offline-safe behavior — App remains usable offline, expired sessions gracefully fallback

### Files Created

**Auth Layer (src/services/api/auth/)**

- `supabaseAuth.types.ts` — Internal Supabase auth types (SupabaseAuthSession, SupabaseAuthError, SupabaseAuthResult)
- `supabaseAuth.client.ts` — Supabase client initialization with SecureStore persistence adapter
- `supabaseAuth.session.ts` — Session management (getCurrentSession, refreshSession, signOutSession, restorePersistedSession, subscribeToAuthChanges)
- `supabaseAuth.mapper.ts` — Type mapping (Supabase → canonical types: mapSupabaseUserToAuthUser, mapSupabaseSessionToRepositoryContext)
- `auth.config.ts` — Environment validation (getSupabaseConfig, isSupabaseConfigured, EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL, EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY)
- `index.ts` — Public API exports

**Auth Services (src/features/auth/services/)**

- `authTransitionOrchestrator.ts` — Transition coordination (beginGuestUpgrade, finalizeGuestUpgrade, beginLogoutTransition, finalizeLogoutTransition)

**Auth Hooks (src/features/auth/hooks/)**

- `useSessionBootstrap.ts` — Offline-safe session restoration (useSessionBootstrap, useSessionReady, useSessionRestoring, useSessionError)

**Auth Utils (src/features/auth/utils/)**

- `authDiagnostics.ts` — Development-only state validation (validateOwnershipConsistency, validateStoragePartitionConsistency, validateRepositoryContextIntegrity, validateMigrationState, detectOrphanedSyncQueueOwnership)

**Sync Ownership (src/services/sync/ownership/)**

- `syncOwnership.ts` — Sync queue ownership validation and enforcement (validateSyncOwnership, assertSyncOwnership, syncItemBelongsToContext, isSyncItemEligibleForUpload, filterUploadEligibleItems)

**Storage Isolation (src/services/storage/)**

- `storageIsolation.ts` — Auth-aware storage clearing utilities (clearGuestPartitions, clearAuthenticatedPartitions, clearSyncPartitions, clearOwnershipScopedData, clearCloudOwnerDataPreserveGuest)

**Documentation**

- `docs/supabase-auth-core-architecture.md` — Comprehensive auth architecture documentation

### Files Modified

**Auth Store (src/features/auth/store/)**

- `useAuthSessionStore.ts` — Added session lifecycle methods (hydrateSession, restoreSession, signOut, setSessionHydrating, setSessionReady, setSessionError), added auth state (authUser, lastSessionRestoreAt, authHydrationStatus, authError)

**Repository Context (src/services/repositories/)**

- `repositoryContext.ts` — Added authenticated context factories (createRepositoryContextFromSession, createRepositoryContextFromAuthUser)

**Sync Queue Compatibility (Phase 13.1 cleanup)**

- `src/features/tasks/services/taskSyncRepository.ts` — Updated to use new ownership metadata with TODOs for Phase 13.2
- `src/services/storage/syncQueue.ts` — Updated recordQueueItem to use new ownership fields
- `src/services/sync/deadLetter/index.ts` — Added compatibility layer for userId migration
- `src/services/sync/queue/queue.validation.ts` — Updated validation with ownership metadata
- `src/services/sync/testing/index.ts` — Updated test utilities to use new ownership fields

### Architecture Decisions

1. **Separate Auth Layer** — Supabase code isolated in `src/services/api/auth/` to prevent direct imports from UI
2. **Type Mapping** — Supabase types mapped immediately to canonical types to maintain single source of truth
3. **SecureStore Persistence** — Supabase tokens stored in SecureStore for security
4. **Offline-First Session Restoration** — App remains usable offline, expired sessions gracefully fallback
5. **Explicit Repository Context** — Repositories receive ownership via context, never from global state
6. **Sync Ownership Enforcement** — Guest sync items never upload, migration items pause safely
7. **Storage Isolation** — Deterministic partition clearing using known keys, no global MMKV wipe
8. **Transition Orchestrator** — Centralized transition coordination to prevent ownership corruption

### Storage Key Patterns

- **Guest entities**: `guest:{localOwnerId}:tasks`, `guest:{localOwnerId}:habits`, `guest:{localOwnerId}:meals`, `guest:{localOwnerId}:budget`, `guest:{localOwnerId}:workouts`, `guest:{localOwnerId}:calendar`
- **Authenticated entities**: `user:{cloudOwnerId}:tasks`, `user:{cloudOwnerId}:habits`, `user:{cloudOwnerId}:meals`, `user:{cloudOwnerId}:budget`, `user:{cloudOwnerId}:workouts`, `user:{cloudOwnerId}:calendar`
- **Guest sync queue**: `guest:{localOwnerId}:syncQueue`
- **Authenticated sync queue**: `user:{cloudOwnerId}:syncQueue`
- **Migration metadata**: `guest:{localOwnerId}:migration`, `user:{cloudOwnerId}:migration`

### What Phase 13.2 Does NOT Do

- No polished auth UI (login/signup screens)
- No social login providers
- No onboarding rewrite
- No analytics integration
- No push notification setup
- No destructive migration execution
- No guest data deletion
- No conflict resolution
- No full repository migration (only tasks as reference)
- No automatic sync replay

### Verification

- TypeScript passes with no errors
- App boots successfully
- Offline launch still works
- Guest mode still works
- No auth UI exists yet
- No repositories directly use Supabase SDK
- No screens directly use Supabase SDK
- Ownership metadata survives hydration
- Storage partitions remain isolated
- Logout does not corrupt local data
- Sync queue respects ownership rules

### Deferred Work

Recommended next phases:

- Phase 13.3 — Build polished auth UI (login/signup screens)
- Phase 13.4 — Implement destructive guest → account migration
- Phase 13.5 — Migrate all features to RepositoryContext pattern
- Phase 13.6 — Add social login providers
- Phase 13.7 — Integrate analytics with auth
- Phase 13.8 — Add push notifications with auth

## Phase 13.1 — Auth Readiness Architecture

### Overview

Architecture-only phase preparing Lumo for Supabase Auth integration without rewriting stores, repositories, sync logic, or local persistence. This phase establishes identity-safe ownership boundaries for guest and authenticated users.

### Core Principles

- UI never talks directly to Supabase — Flow remains: Screen → Feature Hook → Repository → API Service
- Local-first UX is mandatory — User actions remain instant and sync in the background
- Ownership is explicit — Repositories receive ownership via RepositoryContext, never from global state
- Storage is partitioned — Guest and authenticated user data are isolated
- Migration is safe — Guest → account migration is planned and tracked before execution

### Files Created

**Auth Types**

- `src/features/auth/types/auth.types.ts` — Canonical identity types (AccountMode, UserIdentity, RepositoryContext, AccountMigrationPlan)

**Auth Store**

- `src/features/auth/store/useAuthSessionStore.ts` — Auth session store shell with MMKV persistence (accountMode, localOwnerId, cloudOwnerId, sessionStatus, transitionStatus)

**Repository Context**

- `src/services/repositories/repositoryContext.ts` — Repository context provider (getRepositoryContext, createGuestRepositoryContext, createAuthenticatedRepositoryContext, assertRepositoryContext)

**Storage Partitioning**

- `src/services/storage/storagePartition.ts` — Storage partition helpers (getStoragePartitionKey, getEntityStorageKey, getSyncQueueStorageKey, getMigrationStorageKey, validation utilities)

**Sync Queue Ownership**

- `src/services/storage/queue.types.ts` — Updated with ownership metadata (ownerType, localOwnerId, cloudOwnerId, syncPartitionKey, createdDuringMigration)

**Migration Planning**

- `src/features/auth/services/accountMigrationPlan.ts` — Migration plan utilities (createAccountMigrationPlan, validateAccountMigrationPlan, markMigrationStarted, markMigrationComplete)

**Auth Guards**

- `src/features/auth/components/AuthGuard.tsx` — Auth guard component (requireGuest, requireAuthenticated, allowGuest, allowDuringMigration modes)
- `src/features/auth/hooks/useAuthGuard.ts` — Auth guard hook for programmatic access control

### Files Modified

**Tasks Feature (Reference Implementation)**

- `src/features/tasks/services/taskLocalRepository.ts` — Added RepositoryContext support with setRepositoryContext() method and partitioned storage keys

**Sync Queue Types**

- `src/services/storage/queue.types.ts` — Added SyncOwnerType, updated SyncQueueItem and CreateQueueItemInput with ownership metadata

### Architecture Decisions

1. **Separate Auth Session Store** — Created `useAuthSessionStore` separate from existing `useAuthStore` to avoid conflicts and allow gradual migration
2. **RepositoryContext Instead of Global State** — Repositories receive ownership via RepositoryContext for explicit dependencies and easier testing
3. **Storage Partitioning by Owner** — Storage keys include owner ID to prevent data leakage between users
4. **Sync Queue Ownership at Creation Time** — Sync items carry ownership metadata stamped at creation for clear audit trail
5. **Non-Destructive Migration Planning** — Migration plan is created and validated before execution to prevent data loss

### Storage Key Patterns

- **Guest entities**: `guest:{localOwnerId}:tasks`, `guest:{localOwnerId}:habits`
- **Authenticated entities**: `user:{cloudOwnerId}:tasks`, `user:{cloudOwnerId}:habits`
- **Guest sync queue**: `guest:{localOwnerId}:syncQueue`
- **Authenticated sync queue**: `user:{cloudOwnerId}:syncQueue`

### What Phase 13.1 Does NOT Do

- No Supabase Auth wiring
- No polished auth UI (login/signup screens)
- No social login providers
- No onboarding rewrite
- No analytics integration
- No push notification setup
- No destructive migration execution
- No conflict resolution
- No full repository migration (only tasks as reference)
- No guest data deletion

### Verification

- TypeScript passes with no errors
- App still starts
- No auth UI introduced
- No Supabase auth wired yet
- Repositories remain local-first
- Task behavior still works
- Storage keys are ownership-safe where implemented
- Sync queue types can carry ownership metadata

### Deferred Work

Recommended next phases:

- Phase 13.2 — Wire Supabase Auth, implement real login/logout
- Phase 13.3 — Build polished auth UI (login/signup screens)
- Phase 13.4 — Implement destructive guest → account migration
- Phase 13.5 — Migrate all features to RepositoryContext pattern
- Phase 13.6 — Add social login providers
- Phase 13.7 — Integrate analytics with auth
- Phase 13.8 — Add push notifications with auth

## Phase 12.3 — Production QA + Regression Pass

### QA Audits Completed

- **Navigation Audit**:
  - Onboarding redirects verified (first-run flow works correctly)
  - Tab navigation verified (all 5 tabs accessible)
  - Nested More routes hidden from tab bar (href: null)
  - No duplicate headers (headerShown: false on all layouts)
  - No "(tabs)" title regression
  - Back navigation consistent across nested routes

- **Hydration Audit**:
  - Onboarding persistence verified (useOnboardingStore with MMKV)
  - Tasks persistence verified (useTaskStore with error handling)
  - Habits persistence verified (useHabitStore with streak logic)
  - Settings persistence verified (useSettingsStore with new accessibility settings)

- **Feedback States Audit**:
  - Loading states: Tasks, Health, Habits all use LoadingState
  - Empty states: Dashboard, Tasks, Habits have appropriate empty handling
  - Retry states: Tasks uses RetryView with calm error messaging
  - Error boundary: Wrapped root layout, calm fallback UI with retry button

- **Accessibility Audit**:
  - Tab buttons: All have tabBarAccessibilityLabel
  - Task actions: Complete, edit, delete have accessibility labels
  - Habit actions: Add FAB has accessibility label
  - Onboarding actions: Continue/Back buttons have accessibility labels
  - Settings toggles: All switches have accessibilityLabel and accessibilityRole="switch"
  - Touch targets: Maintained at 44px minimum
  - Reduced motion: useReducedMotion hook combines system + user preference
  - Typography: Uses React Native defaults for dynamic font scaling

### Added

- **QA Utilities** (`src/utils/dev/`):
  - `triggerTestError.ts` — Development utility for triggering test errors to verify ErrorBoundary
  - `qaChecks.ts` — Development utility for running basic QA checks on app state
  - Both utilities only run in `__DEV__` mode, no production analytics

### Design Verification

- Calm, low-stimulation UX maintained
- Predictable interactions preserved
- Accessible touch targets maintained (44px minimum)
- Token-backed design system consistent

- **Environment Setup**: `.env.example` with Supabase configuration, `.env` added to `.gitignore`
- **Setup Documentation**: `docs/backend-setup.md` covering architecture, data flow, file structure, extension guide, and security notes

### Dependencies

- `@supabase/supabase-js` — Supabase client SDK
- `expo-secure-store` — Native keychain/keystore token storage
- `react-native-url-polyfill` — URL API polyfill for React Native
- `@react-native-community/netinfo` — Network connectivity detection
- `zustand` — State management (now in package.json)
- `react-native-mmkv` — MMKV storage (now in package.json)

### Architecture

- Repository pattern enforced: UI → Hook → Repository → API Service → Supabase
- Local-first writes with optimistic updates — user interactions never block on network
- Sync queue persists in MMKV, survives app restarts, processes when online
- Sync handlers registered per entity type — extensible to habits, meals, budget
- Auth tokens secured via `expo-secure-store` (native) with `localStorage` web fallback
- Repository factory (`services/repositories/index.ts`) swaps between sync and local implementations
- Storage keys centralized in `services/storage/storageKeys.ts`

### Changed

- Updated `tsconfig.json` with `baseUrl` and `paths` for `@/` alias resolution
- Updated `app/_layout.tsx` to call `initializeBackend()` on mount
- Updated repository factory to use `taskSyncRepository` as default
- Updated `.gitignore` to exclude `.env` files

### Notes

- No auth screens implemented — this phase is infrastructure only
- No React Query — sync is handled via queue + processor pattern
- Supabase client gracefully warns if env vars are missing (app still runs locally)
- Sync processor is a scaffold — entity handlers registered as features connect to backend
- All code is strongly typed with no `any` usage

- Button component (src/components/ui/Button.tsx) with accessibilityRole, accessibilityLabel and accessibilityHint support, reduced motion support, minimum 44x44 touch targets for all sizes, improved pressed states, proper accessibility state for disabled and loading states, and accessible loading indicator
- Card component (src/components/ui/Card.tsx) with new interactive and compact variants, accessibility labels, reduced motion support, improved press states, and accessibilityRole for pressable cards

### Accessibility

- Minimum 44x44 touch targets enforced across all interactive components
- Semantic accessibility roles (button, header, text, adjustable) implemented
- Reduced motion handling integrated with useReducedMotion hook and motion token system
- Predictable focus behavior with keyboardShouldPersistTaps and logical focus order

- Component composition over monolithic screen files
- Token-backed styling maintained throughout all new components

## [Foundation Setup]

### Completed

- Configured Expo Router with Stack navigation
- Updated root layout with hidden headers and calm background (#F8F7FC)
- Created production folder structure (app, components, features, hooks, services, store, theme, types, utils, constants)
- Configured NativeWind with tailwind.config.js, babel.config.js, and nativewind-env.d.ts
- Created design token system (colors, spacing, radius, shadows, typography, tokens)
- Configured Tailwind theme extensions with token-backed values
- Created core UI primitive structure (Screen, Card, Button, IconButton, Text, Input, EmptyState, SectionHeader, ProgressBar, Avatar, FloatingActionButton, BottomSheet)
- Added utility helpers (cn.ts with clsx and tailwind-merge)
- Created initial tab route structure (Dashboard, Tasks, Calendar, Health, More)
- Established feature-first organization with modular subdirectories

### Notes

- No feature screens implemented yet (only placeholders)
- No backend integration yet
- Design tokens follow calm, cinematic, breathable, premium aesthetic
- Primary gradient direction: #89fffd → #ef32d9
- All architecture follows feature-first, local-first, and modular state principles

## [State Architecture + MMKV Persistence]

### Completed

- Configured MMKV storage layer with createMMKV() for react-native-mmkv v4+
- Created reusable storage utilities (getItem, setItem, removeItem, hasItem, clearAll, getAllKeys)
- Implemented shared persist helper (createPersistStorage.ts) bridging MMKV with Zustand persist middleware
- Built production-ready Zustand stores following strict domain isolation:
  - useTaskStore with typed CRUD operations (no persistence - transient data)
  - useHabitStore with typed CRUD operations and MMKV persistence
  - useMealStore with typed CRUD operations (no persistence - transient data)
  - useBudgetStore with typed CRUD operations for transactions and budgets (no persistence)
  - useSettingsStore with MMKV persistence for app preferences and onboarding state
- Applied consistent store pattern: State type, Actions type, Store = State & Actions
- Created mock seed data for tasks (8 realistic tasks) and habits (8 realistic habits)
- Implemented repository layer foundations with local-first architecture:
  - taskRepository with async CRUD methods
  - habitRepository with async CRUD and frequency/date filtering
  - mealRepository with async CRUD and nutrition calculation
  - budgetRepository with async CRUD and budget status checking
- Created comprehensive state architecture documentation (docs/state-architecture.md)
- Documented persistence rules (persist: habits, settings, preferences; don't persist: UI state, modals, filters)
- Documented domain isolation principles and anti-patterns to avoid
- Updated existing MMKV service placeholder to use proper createMMKV() initialization

### Architecture Decisions

- Domain-driven state ownership: each domain (tasks, habits, meals, budget, settings) owns isolated state
- No monolithic global store: split by domain, not by screen or feature
- Typed actions: all stores use TypeScript with explicit State, Actions, and Store types
- Strategic persistence: only persist domain data that should survive app restarts (habits, settings)
- UI state in components: modal visibility, filters, form state use React useState
- Repository pattern: abstracts storage ownership for future backend integration without UI changes
- Thin stores: stores focus on state management, repositories handle business logic
- Granular subscriptions: use selectors to avoid unnecessary rerenders

### Persistence Configuration

- Habits: persisted with MMKV (user's habit tracking data)
- Settings: persisted with MMKV (theme, language, notifications, onboarding state)
- Tasks: not persisted (transient, can be re-fetched from backend)
- Meals: not persisted (transient, can be re-fetched from backend)
- Budget: not persisted (transient, can be re-fetched from backend)

### Notes

- MMKV properly initialized with createMMKV() for react-native-mmkv v4.3.1
- All stores follow the pattern: type State = {}, type Actions = {}, type Store = State & Actions
- Repository classes are backend-ready with async methods for future API integration
- Mock data available for development and testing without backend dependency
- No direct MMKV usage in UI components - all storage abstracted through stores/repositories
