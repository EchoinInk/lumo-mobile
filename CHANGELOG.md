## Phase 14.2 — Calm Mode + Environmental Softening Layer

### Summary

Completed Calm Mode as a reusable environmental softening layer that reduces sensory load, visual intensity, environmental stimulation, motion fatigue, interface pressure, and supports neurodivergent accessibility. Calm Mode is separate from Focus Mode: Focus Mode reduces cognitive complexity, while Calm Mode reduces sensory overwhelm. The implementation works through the existing architecture without creating duplicate themes, screens, or a "minimal app."

2. **Queue Recovery Complexity** — Queue recovery logic is complex and may have edge cases. Future phases should add comprehensive testing.
3. **Offline Queue Growth** — Offline queue may grow unbounded if never cleared. Future phases should add queue size limits and automatic cleanup.
4. **Error Boundary Coverage** — Error boundaries may not catch all error types. Future phases should add error boundary coverage monitoring.

### Recommended Phase 14.0 P1

- Calm mode foundation (src/features/calmMode/)
- Focus mode foundation (src/features/focus/)
- Observability foundation (src/services/observability/)
- Testing foundation (src/testing/)

### Recommended Phase 14.0 P2

- Feature delivery standard documentation
- Production UX rules documentation
- Notification philosophy documentation

## Phase 13.7 — Controlled Destructive Cleanup

### Overview

Phase 13.7 implements controlled guest partition cleanup after migration safety has been proven. This phase is destructive-capable, but cleanup must never run automatically.

### Core Principles

- Cleanup never runs automatically
- Requires explicit confirmation token
- Only deletes verified cleanup candidates
- Enforces rollback window rules
- Preserves rollback metadata until final confirmation
- Prevents cleanup during unsafe migration/sync states
- Makes cleanup resumable and fail-closed
- Tracks cleanup progress and errors

### Core Rule

```
migration ≠ cleanup
```

Migration copies and validates.
Cleanup removes old guest-owned leftovers only after safety gates pass.

### Files Created

**Cleanup Service**

- `src/features/auth/services/migrationCleanup.ts` — Controlled cleanup service:
  - `createCleanupPreview()` — Creates preview of what will be deleted
  - `validateCleanupCandidate()` — Validates cleanup candidate safety
  - `runControlledGuestCleanup()` — Runs controlled cleanup with confirmation token
  - `resumeGuestCleanup()` — Resumes interrupted cleanup
  - `getCleanupStatus()` — Gets current cleanup status
  - `resetCleanupStatus()` — Resets cleanup state

### Files Modified

**Migration Types**

- `src/features/auth/types/migration.types.ts` — Added cleanup types:
  - `GuestCleanupStatus` — Status of cleanup process
  - `GuestCleanupStep` — Steps in cleanup process
  - `GuestCleanupBlockReason` — Reasons for cleanup being blocked
  - `GuestCleanupPreview` — Preview of cleanup operation
  - `GuestCleanupCandidate` — Cleanup candidate information
  - `GuestCleanupResult` — Result of cleanup operation
  - `GuestCleanupError` — Error during cleanup
  - `GuestCleanupState` — Current cleanup state

**Account Screen**

- `app/(tabs)/more/account.tsx` — Added dev-only cleanup controls:
  - "Run controlled cleanup test" button
  - Cleanup result display
  - Only visible in **DEV** mode
  - Does not run on mount
  - Does not use real user data

**Test Harness**

- `src/features/auth/testing/migrationSafetyHarness.ts` — Extended with cleanup integration:
  - `runControlledCleanupHarness()` — Runs full cleanup test harness
  - `verifyMockGuestCleanupCompleted()` — Verifies mock guest data deleted
  - `verifyAuthenticatedDataPreserved()` — Verifies authenticated data preserved

### Cleanup Lifecycle

1. **Migration Completion** — Guest → account migration must complete successfully
2. **Validation Pass** — All validation checks must pass
3. **Rollback Window** — 7-day rollback window must expire
4. **Cleanup Preview** — Create preview of what will be deleted
5. **Confirmation Token** — Explicit confirmation token required
6. **Cleanup Execution** — Delete only verified cleanup candidates
7. **Completion** — Verify authenticated data preserved

### Cleanup Gates

Cleanup is blocked if any of these conditions are not met:

- Migration not completed
- Validation not passed
- Rollback window not expired
- Pending sync transfer
- Active guest ownership
- Candidate not cleanup-safe
- Missing confirmation token
- Unknown owner
- Storage key mismatch
- Rollback snapshot missing

### Confirmation Token Rule

Cleanup must only run when passed:

```ts
confirmationToken: "CONFIRM_GUEST_CLEANUP";
```

If missing or invalid, cleanup returns blocked result. No UI button should call cleanup without this token.

### Cleanup Behavior

**Delete Only:**

- Guest entity partitions already copied + validated
- Guest sync partitions already transferred/prepared
- Migration test partitions if explicitly marked test data
- Orphaned guest partitions marked cleanup eligible

**Never Delete:**

- Active guest session data
- Authenticated partitions
- Rollback snapshot until final cleanup completion
- Unrelated settings
- Global storage

### Fail-Closed Safety

If any check is ambiguous:

- Block cleanup
- Return reason
- Preserve all data

### Resumable Cleanup

Cleanup tracks:

- `cleanupId` — Unique cleanup identifier
- `startedAt` — Timestamp when cleanup started
- `completedAt` — Timestamp when cleanup completed
- `deletedKeys` — Keys successfully deleted
- `skippedKeys` — Keys skipped during cleanup
- `failedKeys` — Keys that failed to delete
- `currentStep` — Current step if paused
- `errors` — Errors encountered during cleanup

If cleanup fails midway:

- Do not retry automatically
- Expose `resumeGuestCleanup()` for manual resume
- Continue only from known safe candidates

### What Phase 13.7 Does NOT Do

- No automatic cleanup
- No deletion of active guest partitions
- No deletion of authenticated partitions
- No sync replay
- No Supabase upload
- No production cleanup UI
- No analytics
- No notifications
- No social login

### Verification

- TypeScript passes with no errors ✓
- Web app boots successfully on http://localhost:8081 ✓
- No import.meta error ✓
- Account route does not spin forever ✓
- Login/signup routes still render ✓
- Guest mode still works ✓
- Cleanup never runs on startup ✓
- Cleanup blocks without confirmation token ✓
- Cleanup blocks before rollback window expires ✓
- Cleanup blocks if validation missing ✓
- Cleanup only deletes mock cleanup candidates in dev harness ✓
- Authenticated data remains ✓
- Rollback metadata preserved until final cleanup step ✓
- No Supabase upload ✓
- No sync replay ✓
- No active guest data deletion ✓

### Risks

1. **Guest Data Orphaning** — Logout generates new localOwnerId, orphaning old guest data. Cleanup needed in future phase.
2. **Migration Record Loss** — If MMKV is cleared, migration tracking records are lost. Future phases should add backup to secure storage.
3. **Rollback Window** — 7-day rollback window may be too short for some users. Future phases should make this configurable.
4. **Partition Discovery** — Current implementation relies on migration tracking records for partition discovery. Future phases should add fallback discovery methods.

### Recommended Phase 13.8

Production Cleanup UI:

- Add production cleanup UI with user confirmation
- Add cleanup progress tracking
- Add cleanup error recovery
- Add cleanup cancellation capability
- Add cleanup history and audit log

## Phase 13.6 — Migration Safety Test Harness

### Overview

Phase 13.6 builds a development-only test harness to prove the guest → account migration safety pass works with disposable local data before destructive cleanup is introduced. This phase is testing + verification only.

### Core Principles

- Testing + verification only
- No automatic deletion
- No silent destructive migration
- No sync replay
- No Supabase upload
- No automatic migration on login
- Explicit method calls only for safety pass
- Only runs in **DEV** mode

### Files Created

**Test Harness Types**

- `src/features/auth/types/migrationTest.types.ts` — Test harness types (MigrationHarnessStatus, MigrationHarnessReport, MigrationHarnessStepResult, MigrationHarnessResult)

**Test Data Utilities**

- `src/features/auth/testing/migrationTestData.ts` — Mock guest data seeding utilities:
  - `seedMockGuestMigrationData()` — Seeds mock guest partitions with test data
  - `seedMockGuestSyncQueue()` — Seeds mock guest sync queue items
  - `clearMockMigrationTestData()` — Clears mock test data
  - `getMockMigrationContexts()` — Gets test repository contexts
  - `verifyMockGuestDataExists()` — Verifies mock guest data exists
  - `verifyMockSyncQueueExists()` — Verifies mock sync queue exists

**Test Harness Service**

- `src/features/auth/testing/migrationSafetyHarness.ts` — Test harness orchestration:
  - `runMigrationSafetyHarness()` — Runs full test harness with validation
  - `resetMigrationSafetyHarness()` — Resets test harness state
  - `getMigrationSafetyHarnessReport()` — Gets current test harness report

### Files Modified

**Account Screen**

- `app/(tabs)/more/account.tsx` — Added dev-only test harness controls:
  - "Run migration safety test" button
  - "Reset migration test data" button
  - Harness result display
  - Only visible in **DEV** mode
  - Does not run on mount
  - Does not use real user data

### Test Harness Flow

1. **Seed Guest Data** — Seeds mock guest partitions with test data (tasks, habits, meals, budget, workouts, calendar)
2. **Seed Guest Sync Queue** — Seeds mock guest sync queue items with pending operations
3. **Create Test Contexts** — Creates guest and authenticated repository contexts with deterministic test IDs
4. **Run Safety Pass** — Calls `runGuestMigrationSafetyPass()` with test contexts
5. **Validate Results** — Verifies:
   - Guest source partitions still exist
   - Target partitions were copied
   - Rollback snapshot was created
   - Sync transfer was prepared
   - Orphan tracking record exists
   - Guest data is untouched
6. **Return Report** — Returns structured test report with validation results

### Test Data Rules

- Only runs in **DEV** mode
- Never runs automatically
- Never touches real active user partitions unless explicitly passed test context
- Uses deterministic test IDs (`test-guest-owner`, `test-cloud-owner`)
- Clears only mock test data when reset is clicked

### What Phase 13.6 Does NOT Do

- No automatic deletion
- No silent destructive migration
- No sync replay
- No Supabase upload
- No automatic migration on login
- No production migration UI
- No analytics
- No notifications
- No social login
- No destructive cleanup

### Verification

- TypeScript passes with no errors ✓
- Web app boots successfully on http://localhost:8081 ✓
- No import.meta error ✓
- Account route does not spin forever ✓
- Login/signup routes still render ✓
- Guest mode still works ✓
- Migration utilities do not run on startup ✓
- No guest data is deleted ✓
- No sync queue replay occurs ✓
- No Supabase upload occurs ✓
- Missing Supabase env vars still fail open to guest mode ✓
- Dev-only harness controls show only in **DEV** ✓
- Running harness completes without deletion ✓
- Mock guest data remains after safety pass ✓
- Target authenticated partitions are copied ✓
- Rollback snapshot is created ✓
- Sync queue transfer is prepared ✓
- Orphan tracking record exists ✓
- Reset clears only mock test data ✓

### Risks

1. **Guest Data Orphaning** — Logout generates new localOwnerId, orphaning old guest data. Cleanup needed in future phase.
2. **Migration Record Loss** — If MMKV is cleared, migration tracking records are lost. Future phases should add backup to secure storage.
3. **Rollback Window** — 7-day rollback window may be too short for some users. Future phases should make this configurable.
4. **Partition Discovery** — Current implementation relies on migration tracking records for partition discovery. Future phases should add fallback discovery methods.

### Recommended Phase 13.7

Destructive Guest Partition Cleanup (only after validation passes):

- Implement actual guest partition deletion after rollback window expires
- Add user confirmation for cleanup
- Add cleanup progress tracking
- Add cleanup error recovery
- Delete orphaned guest partitions after validation passes

## Phase 13.5 — Migration Safety Real Implementation Wiring

### Overview

Phase 13.5 wires the real migration utility implementations into the guest migration orchestrator, replacing stubbed placeholder logic with actual calls to preview, conflict, copy, validation, rollback, sync transfer, and orphaned tracking utilities.

### Core Principles

- Preserve all safety guarantees from Phase 13.4
- No automatic deletion
- No silent destructive migration
- No sync replay
- No Supabase upload
- No automatic migration on login
- Explicit method calls only for safety pass

### Files Modified

**Guest Migration Orchestrator**

- `src/features/auth/services/guestMigrationOrchestrator.ts` — Wired real implementations:
  - `generateMigrationPreview()` from `migrationPreview.ts`
  - `detectConflicts()` and `resolveAllConflicts()` from `migrationConflictStrategy.ts`
  - `copyGuestToAuthenticated()` from `migrationCopy.ts`
  - `validateMigrationCopy()` from `migrationValidation.ts`
  - `createRollbackSnapshot()` from `migrationRollback.ts`
  - `createSyncQueueTransferPreview()` and `prepareSyncQueueTransfer()` from `migrationSyncQueueTransfer.ts`
  - `discoverGuestPartitions()` from `migrationOrphanedGuestTracking.ts`

### Implementation Details

**Safety Pass Flow (Now Real)**

1. **Previewing** — Calls `generateMigrationPreview()` to scan guest partitions and calculate migration size/complexity
2. **Checking Conflicts** — Calls `detectConflicts()` and `resolveAllConflicts()` with "overwrite" strategy
3. **Copying** — Calls `copyGuestToAuthenticated()` to copy guest partitions to authenticated partitions
4. **Validating** — Calls `validateMigrationCopy()` to validate copied data integrity
5. **Preparing Rollback** — Calls `createRollbackSnapshot()` to create rollback snapshot metadata
6. **Preparing Sync Transfer** — Calls `createSyncQueueTransferPreview()` and `prepareSyncQueueTransfer()` to prepare sync queue for ownership transfer
7. **Tracking Orphaned Guest** — Calls `discoverGuestPartitions()` to track migrated guest partitions
8. **Completed** — Safety pass complete with real results

### Safety Guarantees Preserved

- If any step fails, stop immediately
- Rollback metadata preserved if already created
- Source guest data remains untouched
- Target authenticated data not corrupted
- Sync queue never replayed
- Migration does NOT run automatically on login
- Explicit method calls only

### What Phase 13.5 Does NOT Do

- No automatic deletion
- No silent destructive migration
- No sync replay
- No social login
- No analytics
- No notifications
- No guest partition deletion
- No global MMKV wipe
- No Supabase calls from migration utilities
- No repository mutation
- No polished migration UI
- No destructive cleanup
- No sync queue replay

### Verification

- TypeScript passes with no errors ✓
- Web app boots successfully on http://localhost:8081 ✓
- No import.meta error ✓
- Account route does not spin forever ✓
- Login/signup routes still render ✓
- Guest mode still works ✓
- Migration utilities do not run on startup ✓
- No guest data is deleted ✓
- No sync queue replay occurs ✓
- No Supabase upload occurs ✓
- Missing Supabase env vars still fail open to guest mode ✓

### Risks

1. **Guest Data Orphaning** — Logout generates new localOwnerId, orphaning old guest data. Cleanup needed in Phase 13.6.
2. **Migration Record Loss** — If MMKV is cleared, migration tracking records are lost. Future phases should add backup to secure storage.
3. **Rollback Window** — 7-day rollback window may be too short for some users. Future phases should make this configurable.
4. **Partition Discovery** — Current implementation relies on migration tracking records for partition discovery. Future phases should add fallback discovery methods.

### Recommended Phase 13.6

Destructive Guest Partition Cleanup (only after validation passes):

- Implement actual guest partition deletion after rollback window expires
- Add user confirmation for cleanup
- Add cleanup progress tracking
- Add cleanup error recovery
- Delete orphaned guest partitions after validation passes

## Phase 13.4 — Guest Account Migration Safety Integration

### Overview

Migration correctness phase focusing on migration safety before destructive cleanup. Phase 13.4 integrates existing migration safety utilities into a coherent orchestration flow with types, hooks, and auth transition integration.

### Core Principles

- Migration correctness before destructive cleanup
- No automatic deletion
- No silent destructive migration
- No sync replay
- No social login
- No analytics
- No notifications
- Preserve rollback capability
- Preserve local-first behavior
- Deterministic ownership only

### Files Created

**Migration Safety Utilities**

- `src/features/auth/services/migrationPreview.ts` — Migration preview utilities (scan guest partitions, calculate migration size/complexity, identify potential conflicts)
- `src/features/auth/services/migrationCopy.ts` — Deterministic partition copy utilities (copy entity data from guest to authenticated partitions, preserve data integrity)
- `src/features/auth/services/migrationValidation.ts` — Migration validation utilities (validate copied data integrity, verify entity counts match, detect data corruption)
- `src/features/auth/services/migrationConflictStrategy.ts` — Conflict strategy scaffolding (define conflict resolution strategies, detect conflict types, apply conflict resolution)
- `src/features/auth/services/migrationRollback.ts` — Safe rollback path utilities (create rollback snapshot before migration, restore from rollback snapshot, validate rollback integrity)
- `src/features/auth/services/migrationSyncQueueTransfer.ts` — Sync queue transfer preparation utilities (prepare guest-owned sync queue items for authenticated ownership, convert ownership metadata)
- `src/features/auth/services/migrationOrphanedGuestTracking.ts` — Orphaned guest partition tracking utilities (track migrated/orphaned guest partitions, detect cleanup candidates, preserve rollback capability)

**Migration Orchestration (Phase 13.4 Integration)**

- `src/features/auth/types/migration.types.ts` — Migration type definitions (steps, statuses, reports, results)
- `src/features/auth/services/guestMigrationOrchestrator.ts` — Migration orchestration service (integrates safety utilities into deterministic flow)
- `src/features/auth/hooks/useGuestMigrationStatus.ts` — Migration status hook (exposes migration state and safe action methods)

### Files Modified

**Auth Transition Orchestrator**

- `src/features/auth/services/authTransitionOrchestrator.ts` — Added `prepareGuestUpgradeSafety()` and `completeGuestUpgradeSafety()` methods for explicit migration safety pass execution

**Account Screen**

- `app/(tabs)/more/account.tsx` — Added debug-only migration diagnostics section (shows account mode, owner IDs, migration status, rollback availability, cleanup eligibility)

**Storage Imports**

- Fixed TypeScript errors in 8 migration service files by changing imports from `storage` (not exported) to `storageInstance` (exported)

### Architecture

**Orchestration Flow**

The guest migration orchestrator integrates all safety utilities into a deterministic safety pass:

1. **Previewing** — Scan guest partitions and calculate migration size/complexity
2. **Checking Conflicts** — Identify potential conflicts (skipped in current implementation)
3. **Copying** — Copy guest partitions to authenticated partitions
4. **Validating** — Validate copied data integrity
5. **Preparing Rollback** — Create rollback snapshot metadata
6. **Preparing Sync Transfer** — Prepare sync queue for ownership transfer
7. **Tracking Orphaned Guest** — Track migrated guest partitions
8. **Completed** — Safety pass complete

**Safety Pass Lifecycle**

```
Idle → Previewing → Checking Conflicts → Copying → Validating → Preparing Rollback → Preparing Sync Transfer → Tracking Orphaned Guest → Completed
                                    ↓
                                 Failed
```

**Failure Behavior**

If any step fails:

- Stop immediately
- Preserve rollback metadata if already created
- Source guest data remains untouched
- Target authenticated data not corrupted
- Error message captured in report
- Failure reason recorded
- Rollback remains available if snapshot exists

### Safety Guarantees

- If any step fails, stop safely
- Rollback metadata must remain available
- Source guest data must remain untouched
- Target authenticated data must not be corrupted
- Sync queue must not be replayed
- Migration does NOT run automatically on login
- Explicit method calls only for migration safety pass

### What Phase 13.4 Does NOT Do

- No automatic deletion
- No silent destructive migration
- No sync replay
- No social login
- No analytics
- No notifications
- No guest partition deletion
- No global MMKV wipe
- No Supabase calls from migration utilities
- No repository mutation
- No polished migration UI
- No destructive cleanup
- No sync queue replay

### Verification

- TypeScript passes with no errors
- Web app boots successfully
- No import.meta error
- Account route does not spin forever
- Login/signup routes still render
- Guest mode still works
- Migration utilities do not run on startup
- No guest data is deleted
- No sync queue replay occurs
- No Supabase upload occurs
- Missing Supabase env vars still fail open to guest mode

### Risks

1. **Guest Data Orphaning** — Logout generates new localOwnerId, orphaning old guest data. Cleanup needed in Phase 13.6.
2. **Migration Record Loss** — If MMKV is cleared, migration tracking records are lost. Future phases should add backup to secure storage.
3. **Rollback Window** — 7-day rollback window may be too short for some users. Future phases should make this configurable.
4. **Partition Discovery** — Current implementation relies on migration tracking records for partition discovery. Future phases should add fallback discovery methods.

### Deferred Work

Recommended next phases:

- Phase 13.5 — Integrate migration utilities with actual copy/validation/rollback implementations (currently stubbed)
- Phase 13.6 — Destructive Guest Partition Cleanup (only after validation passes)
- Phase 13.7 — Migration Backup to Secure Storage
- Phase 13.8 — Configurable Rollback Window

## Phase 13.3 — Minimal Auth Screens + Guarded Entry

### Overview

UI-only phase adding minimal login/signup screens, guarded account route, and logout flow on top of Phase 13.2 auth infrastructure. This phase proves the auth flow works without overbuilding auth UX.

### Core Principles

- Screens remain thin and minimal
- Auth logic lives in hooks/services, not screens
- Calm, non-alarming feedback states
- Guest mode preserved
- Local-first behavior preserved
- No onboarding rewrites
- No destructive guest → account migration

### Files Created

**Auth Routes**

- `src/app/auth/_layout.tsx` — Auth stack layout
- `src/app/auth/login.tsx` — Login screen with email/password form
- `src/app/auth/signup.tsx` — Signup screen with email/password form

**Account Route**

- `app/(tabs)/more/account.tsx` — Guarded account screen with logout

**Auth Hook**

- `src/features/auth/hooks/useAuthForm.ts` — Auth form state management (email, password, validation, error normalization)

**Documentation**

- `docs/minimal-auth-screens.md` — Auth screens architecture documentation

### Files Modified

**Auth Service**

- `src/services/api/auth/supabaseAuth.session.ts` — Added `signInWithEmailPassword`, `signUpWithEmailPassword` methods
- `src/services/api/auth/index.ts` — Re-exported new auth methods

**More Screen**

- `app/(tabs)/more/index.tsx` — Added account/sign-in entry with conditional icon (LogIn for guest, User for authenticated)

### Architecture Decisions

1. **Thin Screens** — Auth screens are minimal, using existing UI primitives (Screen, Input, Button, Text)
2. **Auth Form Hook** — Form state and validation isolated in `useAuthForm` hook, not in screens
3. **Error Normalization** — Supabase errors normalized into calm user-facing messages
4. **Guarded Account** — Account screen uses `AuthGuard` with `requireAuthenticated` mode and calm fallback
5. **Logout Flow** — Logout uses transition orchestrator, signs out from Supabase and session store, preserves guest mode
6. **More Screen Entry** — Account entry conditionally shows "Sign in" or "Account" based on auth state

### Auth Flow

**Login Flow:**

- User enters email/password → `useAuthForm.signIn()` → `signInWithEmailPassword()` → Supabase auth → On success: beginGuestUpgrade → setAuthenticatedSession → finalizeGuestUpgrade → Navigate to account

**Signup Flow:**

- User enters email/password → `useAuthForm.signUp()` → `signUpWithEmailPassword()` → Supabase auth → On success: beginGuestUpgrade → setAuthenticatedSession → finalizeGuestUpgrade → Navigate to account

**Logout Flow:**

- User taps sign out → beginLogoutTransition → signOutSession → signOut → finalizeLogoutTransition → Navigate back to More

### Feedback States

- **Loading:** Button shows ActivityIndicator when submitting
- **Invalid Form:** Error message below form fields, red border on error
- **Auth Error:** Calm error message (e.g., "We couldn't sign you in. Please check your email and password.")
- **Logged-Out Fallback:** Calm message with login/signup actions

### What Phase 13.3 Does NOT Do

- No social login
- No analytics
- No push notifications
- No onboarding redesign
- No polished marketing auth screens
- No destructive guest → account migration
- No Supabase calls in screens
- No giant auth store
- No auth UI owning persistence
- No profile editing
- No complex account settings

### Verification

- TypeScript passes with no errors
- App boots successfully
- Guest mode still works
- Login screen renders
- Signup screen renders
- Account screen is guarded
- Logout returns to guest mode
- Screens do not import Supabase SDK
- Repositories do not import Supabase SDK
- Auth UI does not delete guest data
- More screen entry works

### Deferred Work

Recommended next phases:

- Phase 13.4 — Implement destructive guest → account migration
- Phase 13.5 — Migrate all features to RepositoryContext pattern
- Phase 13.6 — Add social login providers
- Phase 13.7 — Integrate analytics with auth
- Phase 13.8 — Add push notifications with auth

## Phase 13.2 — Supabase Auth Integration Core

### Overview

Infrastructure-first phase implementing actual auth/session infrastructure using Supabase Auth without introducing auth debt, UI coupling, or breaking local-first behavior. This phase wires Supabase Auth into Lumo while preserving the architecture established in Phase 13.1.

### Core Principles

- UI never talks directly to Supabase — Flow remains: Screen → Feature Hook → Repository → API Service
- Local-first UX is mandatory — User actions remain instant and sync in the background
- Ownership is explicit — Repositories receive ownership via RepositoryContext, never from global state
- Storage is partitioned — Guest and authenticated user data are isolated
- Migration is safe — Guest → account migration is planned and tracked before execution
- Offline-safe behavior — App remains usable offline, expired sessions gracefully fallback

### Files Created

**Auth Layer (src/services/api/auth/)**

- `supabaseAuth.types.ts` — Internal Supabase auth types (SupabaseAuthSession, SupabaseAuthError, SupabaseAuthResult)
- `supabaseAuth.client.ts` — Supabase client initialization with SecureStore persistence adapter
- `supabaseAuth.session.ts` — Session management (getCurrentSession, refreshSession, signOutSession, restorePersistedSession, subscribeToAuthChanges)
- `supabaseAuth.mapper.ts` — Type mapping (Supabase → canonical types: mapSupabaseUserToAuthUser, mapSupabaseSessionToRepositoryContext)
- `auth.config.ts` — Environment validation (getSupabaseConfig, isSupabaseConfigured, EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL, EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY)
- `index.ts` — Public API exports

**Auth Services (src/features/auth/services/)**

- `authTransitionOrchestrator.ts` — Transition coordination (beginGuestUpgrade, finalizeGuestUpgrade, beginLogoutTransition, finalizeLogoutTransition)

**Auth Hooks (src/features/auth/hooks/)**

- `useSessionBootstrap.ts` — Offline-safe session restoration (useSessionBootstrap, useSessionReady, useSessionRestoring, useSessionError)

**Auth Utils (src/features/auth/utils/)**

- `authDiagnostics.ts` — Development-only state validation (validateOwnershipConsistency, validateStoragePartitionConsistency, validateRepositoryContextIntegrity, validateMigrationState, detectOrphanedSyncQueueOwnership)

**Sync Ownership (src/services/sync/ownership/)**

- `syncOwnership.ts` — Sync queue ownership validation and enforcement (validateSyncOwnership, assertSyncOwnership, syncItemBelongsToContext, isSyncItemEligibleForUpload, filterUploadEligibleItems)

**Storage Isolation (src/services/storage/)**

- `storageIsolation.ts` — Auth-aware storage clearing utilities (clearGuestPartitions, clearAuthenticatedPartitions, clearSyncPartitions, clearOwnershipScopedData, clearCloudOwnerDataPreserveGuest)

**Documentation**

- `docs/supabase-auth-core-architecture.md` — Comprehensive auth architecture documentation

### Files Modified

**Auth Store (src/features/auth/store/)**

- `useAuthSessionStore.ts` — Added session lifecycle methods (hydrateSession, restoreSession, signOut, setSessionHydrating, setSessionReady, setSessionError), added auth state (authUser, lastSessionRestoreAt, authHydrationStatus, authError)

**Repository Context (src/services/repositories/)**

- `repositoryContext.ts` — Added authenticated context factories (createRepositoryContextFromSession, createRepositoryContextFromAuthUser)

**Sync Queue Compatibility (Phase 13.1 cleanup)**

- `src/features/tasks/services/taskSyncRepository.ts` — Updated to use new ownership metadata with TODOs for Phase 13.2
- `src/services/storage/syncQueue.ts` — Updated recordQueueItem to use new ownership fields
- `src/services/sync/deadLetter/index.ts` — Added compatibility layer for userId migration
- `src/services/sync/queue/queue.validation.ts` — Updated validation with ownership metadata
- `src/services/sync/testing/index.ts` — Updated test utilities to use new ownership fields

### Architecture Decisions

1. **Separate Auth Layer** — Supabase code isolated in `src/services/api/auth/` to prevent direct imports from UI
2. **Type Mapping** — Supabase types mapped immediately to canonical types to maintain single source of truth
3. **SecureStore Persistence** — Supabase tokens stored in SecureStore for security
4. **Offline-First Session Restoration** — App remains usable offline, expired sessions gracefully fallback
5. **Explicit Repository Context** — Repositories receive ownership via context, never from global state
6. **Sync Ownership Enforcement** — Guest sync items never upload, migration items pause safely
7. **Storage Isolation** — Deterministic partition clearing using known keys, no global MMKV wipe
8. **Transition Orchestrator** — Centralized transition coordination to prevent ownership corruption

### Storage Key Patterns

- **Guest entities**: `guest:{localOwnerId}:tasks`, `guest:{localOwnerId}:habits`, `guest:{localOwnerId}:meals`, `guest:{localOwnerId}:budget`, `guest:{localOwnerId}:workouts`, `guest:{localOwnerId}:calendar`
- **Authenticated entities**: `user:{cloudOwnerId}:tasks`, `user:{cloudOwnerId}:habits`, `user:{cloudOwnerId}:meals`, `user:{cloudOwnerId}:budget`, `user:{cloudOwnerId}:workouts`, `user:{cloudOwnerId}:calendar`
- **Guest sync queue**: `guest:{localOwnerId}:syncQueue`
- **Authenticated sync queue**: `user:{cloudOwnerId}:syncQueue`
- **Migration metadata**: `guest:{localOwnerId}:migration`, `user:{cloudOwnerId}:migration`

### What Phase 13.2 Does NOT Do

- No polished auth UI (login/signup screens)
- No social login providers
- No onboarding rewrite
- No analytics integration
- No push notification setup
- No destructive migration execution
- No guest data deletion
- No conflict resolution
- No full repository migration (only tasks as reference)
- No automatic sync replay

### Verification

- TypeScript passes with no errors
- App boots successfully
- Offline launch still works
- Guest mode still works
- No auth UI exists yet
- No repositories directly use Supabase SDK
- No screens directly use Supabase SDK
- Ownership metadata survives hydration
- Storage partitions remain isolated
- Logout does not corrupt local data
- Sync queue respects ownership rules

### Deferred Work

Recommended next phases:

- Phase 13.3 — Build polished auth UI (login/signup screens)
- Phase 13.4 — Implement destructive guest → account migration
- Phase 13.5 — Migrate all features to RepositoryContext pattern
- Phase 13.6 — Add social login providers
- Phase 13.7 — Integrate analytics with auth
- Phase 13.8 — Add push notifications with auth

## Phase 13.1 — Auth Readiness Architecture

### Overview

Architecture-only phase preparing Lumo for Supabase Auth integration without rewriting stores, repositories, sync logic, or local persistence. This phase establishes identity-safe ownership boundaries for guest and authenticated users.

### Core Principles

- UI never talks directly to Supabase — Flow remains: Screen → Feature Hook → Repository → API Service
- Local-first UX is mandatory — User actions remain instant and sync in the background
- Ownership is explicit — Repositories receive ownership via RepositoryContext, never from global state
- Storage is partitioned — Guest and authenticated user data are isolated
- Migration is safe — Guest → account migration is planned and tracked before execution

### Files Created

**Auth Types**

- `src/features/auth/types/auth.types.ts` — Canonical identity types (AccountMode, UserIdentity, RepositoryContext, AccountMigrationPlan)

**Auth Store**

- `src/features/auth/store/useAuthSessionStore.ts` — Auth session store shell with MMKV persistence (accountMode, localOwnerId, cloudOwnerId, sessionStatus, transitionStatus)

**Repository Context**

- `src/services/repositories/repositoryContext.ts` — Repository context provider (getRepositoryContext, createGuestRepositoryContext, createAuthenticatedRepositoryContext, assertRepositoryContext)

**Storage Partitioning**

- `src/services/storage/storagePartition.ts` — Storage partition helpers (getStoragePartitionKey, getEntityStorageKey, getSyncQueueStorageKey, getMigrationStorageKey, validation utilities)

**Sync Queue Ownership**

- `src/services/storage/queue.types.ts` — Updated with ownership metadata (ownerType, localOwnerId, cloudOwnerId, syncPartitionKey, createdDuringMigration)

**Migration Planning**

- `src/features/auth/services/accountMigrationPlan.ts` — Migration plan utilities (createAccountMigrationPlan, validateAccountMigrationPlan, markMigrationStarted, markMigrationComplete)

**Auth Guards**

- `src/features/auth/components/AuthGuard.tsx` — Auth guard component (requireGuest, requireAuthenticated, allowGuest, allowDuringMigration modes)
- `src/features/auth/hooks/useAuthGuard.ts` — Auth guard hook for programmatic access control

### Files Modified

**Tasks Feature (Reference Implementation)**

- `src/features/tasks/services/taskLocalRepository.ts` — Added RepositoryContext support with setRepositoryContext() method and partitioned storage keys

**Sync Queue Types**

- `src/services/storage/queue.types.ts` — Added SyncOwnerType, updated SyncQueueItem and CreateQueueItemInput with ownership metadata

### Architecture Decisions

1. **Separate Auth Session Store** — Created `useAuthSessionStore` separate from existing `useAuthStore` to avoid conflicts and allow gradual migration
2. **RepositoryContext Instead of Global State** — Repositories receive ownership via RepositoryContext for explicit dependencies and easier testing
3. **Storage Partitioning by Owner** — Storage keys include owner ID to prevent data leakage between users
4. **Sync Queue Ownership at Creation Time** — Sync items carry ownership metadata stamped at creation for clear audit trail
5. **Non-Destructive Migration Planning** — Migration plan is created and validated before execution to prevent data loss

### Storage Key Patterns

- **Guest entities**: `guest:{localOwnerId}:tasks`, `guest:{localOwnerId}:habits`
- **Authenticated entities**: `user:{cloudOwnerId}:tasks`, `user:{cloudOwnerId}:habits`
- **Guest sync queue**: `guest:{localOwnerId}:syncQueue`
- **Authenticated sync queue**: `user:{cloudOwnerId}:syncQueue`

### What Phase 13.1 Does NOT Do

- No Supabase Auth wiring
- No polished auth UI (login/signup screens)
- No social login providers
- No onboarding rewrite
- No analytics integration
- No push notification setup
- No destructive migration execution
- No conflict resolution
- No full repository migration (only tasks as reference)
- No guest data deletion

### Verification

- TypeScript passes with no errors
- App still starts
- No auth UI introduced
- No Supabase auth wired yet
- Repositories remain local-first
- Task behavior still works
- Storage keys are ownership-safe where implemented
- Sync queue types can carry ownership metadata

### Deferred Work

Recommended next phases:

- Phase 13.2 — Wire Supabase Auth, implement real login/logout
- Phase 13.3 — Build polished auth UI (login/signup screens)
- Phase 13.4 — Implement destructive guest → account migration
- Phase 13.5 — Migrate all features to RepositoryContext pattern
- Phase 13.6 — Add social login providers
- Phase 13.7 — Integrate analytics with auth
- Phase 13.8 — Add push notifications with auth

## Phase 12.3 — Production QA + Regression Pass

### QA Audits Completed

  - Settings toggles: All switches have accessibilityLabel and accessibilityRole="switch"
  - Touch targets: Maintained at 44px minimum
  - Reduced motion: useReducedMotion hook combines system + user preference
  - Typography: Uses React Native defaults for dynamic font scaling

### Added

- **QA Utilities** (`src/utils/dev/`):
  - `triggerTestError.ts` — Development utility for triggering test errors to verify ErrorBoundary
  - `qaChecks.ts` — Development utility for running basic QA checks on app state
  - Both utilities only run in `__DEV__` mode, no production analytics

### Design Verification

- Calm, low-stimulation UX maintained
- Predictable interactions preserved
- Accessible touch targets maintained (44px minimum)
- Token-backed design system consistent
- No noisy motion or animation-heavy transitions
- Spacing rhythm consistent (using Spacing tokens)

### Technical

- Preserved local-first architecture
- Screen → Hook → Store → Repository → Storage flow maintained
- No backend, Supabase, auth, analytics, notifications, or React Query added
- TypeScript passes with no errors
- No regressions found in navigation, hydration, or feedback states

### Remaining Known Issues

- None identified during this QA pass

- `@react-native-community/netinfo` — Network connectivity detection
- `zustand` — State management (now in package.json)
- `react-native-mmkv` — MMKV storage (now in package.json)

### Architecture

- Repository pattern enforced: UI → Hook → Repository → API Service → Supabase
- Local-first writes with optimistic updates — user interactions never block on network
- Sync queue persists in MMKV, survives app restarts, processes when online
- Sync handlers registered per entity type — extensible to habits, meals, budget
- Auth tokens secured via `expo-secure-store` (native) with `localStorage` web fallback
- Repository factory (`services/repositories/index.ts`) swaps between sync and local implementations
- Storage keys centralized in `services/storage/storageKeys.ts`

### Changed

- Updated `tsconfig.json` with `baseUrl` and `paths` for `@/` alias resolution
- Updated `app/_layout.tsx` to call `initializeBackend()` on mount
- Updated repository factory to use `taskSyncRepository` as default
- Updated `.gitignore` to exclude `.env` files

### Notes

- No auth screens implemented — this phase is infrastructure only
- No React Query — sync is handled via queue + processor pattern
- Supabase client gracefully warns if env vars are missing (app still runs locally)
- Sync processor is a scaffold — entity handlers registered as features connect to backend
- All code is strongly typed with no `any` usage

### Updated

- Screen component (src/components/ui/Screen.tsx) with centered variant, keyboardShouldPersistTaps, accessibility props, content width constraint from UX tokens, and improved accessibility behavior
- Button component (src/components/ui/Button.tsx) with accessibilityRole, accessibilityLabel and accessibilityHint support, reduced motion support, minimum 44x44 touch targets for all sizes, improved pressed states, proper accessibility state for disabled and loading states, and accessible loading indicator
- Card component (src/components/ui/Card.tsx) with new interactive and compact variants, accessibility labels, reduced motion support, improved press states, and accessibilityRole for pressable cards

### Accessibility

- Minimum 44x44 touch targets enforced across all interactive components
- Semantic accessibility roles (button, header, text, adjustable) implemented
- Reduced motion handling integrated with useReducedMotion hook and motion token system
- Predictable focus behavior with keyboardShouldPersistTaps and logical focus order
- Improved screen reader support with proper accessibilityLabel, accessibilityHint, and accessibilityState props

- Component composition over monolithic screen files
- Token-backed styling maintained throughout all new components

## [Foundation Setup]

### Completed

- Configured Expo Router with Stack navigation
- Updated root layout with hidden headers and calm background (#F8F7FC)
- Created production folder structure (app, components, features, hooks, services, store, theme, types, utils, constants)
- Configured NativeWind with tailwind.config.js, babel.config.js, and nativewind-env.d.ts
- Created design token system (colors, spacing, radius, shadows, typography, tokens)
- Configured Tailwind theme extensions with token-backed values
- Created core UI primitive structure (Screen, Card, Button, IconButton, Text, Input, EmptyState, SectionHeader, ProgressBar, Avatar, FloatingActionButton, BottomSheet)
- Added utility helpers (cn.ts with clsx and tailwind-merge)
- Created initial tab route structure (Dashboard, Tasks, Calendar, Health, More)
- Established feature-first organization with modular subdirectories

### Notes

- No feature screens implemented yet (only placeholders)
- No backend integration yet
- Design tokens follow calm, cinematic, breathable, premium aesthetic
- Primary gradient direction: #89fffd → #ef32d9
- All architecture follows feature-first, local-first, and modular state principles

## [State Architecture + MMKV Persistence]

### Completed

- Configured MMKV storage layer with createMMKV() for react-native-mmkv v4+
- Created reusable storage utilities (getItem, setItem, removeItem, hasItem, clearAll, getAllKeys)
- Implemented shared persist helper (createPersistStorage.ts) bridging MMKV with Zustand persist middleware
- Built production-ready Zustand stores following strict domain isolation:
  - useTaskStore with typed CRUD operations (no persistence - transient data)
  - useHabitStore with typed CRUD operations and MMKV persistence
  - useMealStore with typed CRUD operations (no persistence - transient data)
  - useBudgetStore with typed CRUD operations for transactions and budgets (no persistence)
  - useSettingsStore with MMKV persistence for app preferences and onboarding state
- Applied consistent store pattern: State type, Actions type, Store = State & Actions
- Created mock seed data for tasks (8 realistic tasks) and habits (8 realistic habits)
- Implemented repository layer foundations with local-first architecture:
  - taskRepository with async CRUD methods
  - habitRepository with async CRUD and frequency/date filtering
  - mealRepository with async CRUD and nutrition calculation
  - budgetRepository with async CRUD and budget status checking
- Created comprehensive state architecture documentation (docs/state-architecture.md)
- Documented persistence rules (persist: habits, settings, preferences; don't persist: UI state, modals, filters)
- Documented domain isolation principles and anti-patterns to avoid
- Updated existing MMKV service placeholder to use proper createMMKV() initialization

### Architecture Decisions

- Domain-driven state ownership: each domain (tasks, habits, meals, budget, settings) owns isolated state
- No monolithic global store: split by domain, not by screen or feature
- Typed actions: all stores use TypeScript with explicit State, Actions, and Store types
- Strategic persistence: only persist domain data that should survive app restarts (habits, settings)
- UI state in components: modal visibility, filters, form state use React useState
- Repository pattern: abstracts storage ownership for future backend integration without UI changes
- Thin stores: stores focus on state management, repositories handle business logic
- Granular subscriptions: use selectors to avoid unnecessary rerenders

### Persistence Configuration

- Habits: persisted with MMKV (user's habit tracking data)
- Settings: persisted with MMKV (theme, language, notifications, onboarding state)
- Tasks: not persisted (transient, can be re-fetched from backend)
- Meals: not persisted (transient, can be re-fetched from backend)
- Budget: not persisted (transient, can be re-fetched from backend)

### Notes

- MMKV properly initialized with createMMKV() for react-native-mmkv v4.3.1
- All stores follow the pattern: type State = {}, type Actions = {}, type Store = State & Actions
- Repository classes are backend-ready with async methods for future API integration
- Mock data available for development and testing without backend dependency
- No direct MMKV usage in UI components - all storage abstracted through stores/repositories
